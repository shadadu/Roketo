       "[{'question': 'Would an elongated rocket launch tube NOW be feasible and economical?\\nThe general idea is to make rocket launches far more economical than they currently are... maybe even within eventual affordable range for the general populace! The goal of a tube is to significantly reduce the energy needed for the rocket to deliver its payload into orbit, as constraining the rocket\\'s exhaust  should  return a lot of energy back to the rocket itself (particularly in conjunction with a sabot  Edit:  This does NOT necessarily mean a \"piston\"; see addendum. ). At a glance, this seems to be a more feasible (and potentially economical) alternative to other extreme solutions, such as space elevators, spin launchers, space tethers, etc., which do not seem to even be achievable with current material sciences (to say nothing of budgets). \\n Consider what the optimal choice of these options must be (assuming state-of-the-art solutions applied to each of their implementations): \\n \\n Design a long launch tube such that the most energy-intensive part of the launch is accommodated, which is probably about the first quarter of the launch journey, at most. After that point, further needed thrust can be managed with more conventional rocket technology, but now in a slimmer form. The tube can have a curved shape, as needed. \\n Building such a tube would be an engineering wonder if it were just a stand-alone structure. Maybe divide the structure between a large, unsophisticated earthen mound, and a \\'tall tower\\' built atop said mound. Erect both of these structures to the highest extent that is feasible and economical for the goal at hand. \\n Alternatively, bore a hole into a tall mountain, or maybe just any other place best suited for such a hole. I don\\'t know what the ideal elevation amount would be to terminate the length of the tube at, and maybe just a \\'rather deep hole\\' would suffice (regardless of elevation). It would certainly be cheaper than a \\'tall tube tower\\', though may be subject to geological factors. Maybe a middle ground option would be ideal? \\n To solve the problem of launch exhaust damaging the tube, make the initial launch point have a cavity for the exhaust to harmlessly expand. The further the rocket goes, the higher it\\'s velocity, and the less duration/amount of its exhaust is exposed to any given area of the tube. Therefore, the tube could \"tighten up\", further along its length. \\n Furthermore, if the tube is built into (reinforced) solid earth, the force alone from the exhaust shouldn\\'t easily be able to destroy the tube structure. The tube lining, however, will need special accommodation against the heat and blast force. Besides heat-resistant lining materials, venting, cooling, or even necessitated repairs might come into play. \\n To solve the problem of rocket friction against the tube, the rocket could be enclosed in a sabot, or possibly constrained to a track (or both). Friction upon these components could be further reduced with either (or both) a form of maglev technology, or an air cushion effect (akin to a hovercraft). \\n To solve the problem of rocket exhaust damaging the rocket, the aforementioned sabot could be designed to shield the rocket. The sabot could even feature something to the effect of  deteriorating materials  or a cooling system, if needed. \\n To solve the problem of air friction in front of the rocket, mechanical pumps and a gating system can be used to maintain a vacuum state inside the tube. Alternatively (or in addition?), an explosive gas can be pumped into the tube and ignited to reduce its pressure by way of directional vents, which redirect the displaced gasses. These vents may also be used to take some of the edge off the rocket\\'s exhaust, if needed. \\n \\n So my question is: With all of these solutions in mind, are rockets still simply \"too violent\" for a launch tube to be feasible? Also, would this tube fail to make their launches economical enough to justify its cost? \\n Edit:  An important added note, as mentioned in a comment below: \\n \\n Furthermore, it may not be necessary to create a full \"sealed piston\" effect [with a sabot]. The lift of a normal rocket happens most upon the small area where the ignition takes place, and the pressure wave of the exhaust can similarly exert upon even a small amount of surface area of the rocket/sabot/\"piston\" for all the additional thrust that could be needed... or even physically possible. Pending calculations, of course...',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The existing answers  here  covers a lot. Looking specifically at using a tube to build pressure and push the rocket along there is a very specific issue to do with the  speed of sound  in that the rate of expansion of a gas, and therefore the peak muzzle velocity is limited to the local speed of sound. This as first order approximation means that once your rocket exceeds Mach 1 it no longer gets benefit from the pressure in the tube behind it and most likely suffers increasing drag over the same rocket in free flight. \\n There are some limited cheats here - increasing pressure and temperature increase the speed of sound for the same material a bit, but more usefully lowering molecular mass, leading to  Light-gas Guns  using hyrdogen. These can get muzzle velocities very close to orbital, albeit rather violently. The constraint here is that you cannot be burning the hydrogen into something else first, so you get to use the hydrogen straight in a giant air-gun OR burn it in a rocket but not both. \\n Also relevant here is that if aim is to fire something down a barrel, putting the propellant IN the projectile is less efficient than leaving it stationary. \\n So in general if building a mega structure half way to orbit is possible finishing the job and making it a rail gun or similar electromagnetic system makes more sense than trying to run the rocket inside it and setting every thing on fire. If you cannot build the  structure  than how it might make a rocket better is moot. \\n In terms of keeping a barrel at vacuum any active system involving setting off explosions or large capacity pumps have the challenge that the departing projectile encounters substantial supersonic turbulence approaching the transition to stmosphere.

       " {'question': 'Does NASA have any rocket options to replace ISS segments?\\nRoscosmos  has announced their ISS partnership will end in 2 years \\n \\n This might have been seen as an indication that the new administration at Roscosmos was in a more cooperative mood. Any such hopes were dashed on Tuesday, when Borisov announced that Russia would not be renewing its current commitment to the ISS, which ends in 2024. NASA\\'s current plans involve keeping the station occupied through the end of the decade. \\n \\n It\\'s not clear what their plans are, but the new head of Roscosmos did say this \\n \\n According to The New York Times, Borisov told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the 2024 date gives his country time as well. “I think that by this time, we will begin to form the Russian orbital station,” he said. \\n \\n In theory, Russia may want some of its ISS segments back for this \"new\" Russian space station. That  does present a problem , in that we need some of those modules, and a decent chunk of our modules were flown on the now-defunct Space Shuttle. \\n From  a different article in March , it seems like  NASA\\'s Cygnus module  could be used to replace the Russian boosting capacity. The catch is that the rocket that took it up there (Atlas V) was made with Russian engines and all the ones we still have are spoken for. \\n \\n Cygnus has previously launched on the American-made Atlas V rocket. But this booster also uses Russian-made engines. Because of that, the Atlas V was already due to be phased out later this decade after completing two dozen more launches. The Atlas V rocket developer, United Launch Alliance, has taken delivery of all the Russian engines it needs for these flights. Although these missions are all booked, one solution may be for Amazon to give back some of the nine Atlas V launches it has reserved for its Project Kuiper satellite constellation. Another scenario involves launching Cygnus on a Falcon 9 rocket, something Northrop and SpaceX would probably agree upon in an emergency situation. \\n Another potential re-boost solution could come from Boeing\\'s Starliner spacecraft, but this vehicle has not yet demonstrated the ability to dock safely with the International Space Station. And it, too, is reliant upon launching on the Atlas V rocket. \\n \\n The SLS is still in testing and, given the enormous cost of a heavy lift non-reusable vehicle, it seems unlikely to be used for the ISS. \\n Could a Falcon Heavy do the trick for another Cygnus, or an entirely new ISS module? Or would any hopes for heavy lift capacity be in rockets not yet built/flown?',\n",
       "  'answer': \"The main issue for American providers is that there is no real space tug available off the shelf.  The Russians often used a modified propulsion module from Progress (Posik, Pirs, Prichal modules) vehicles, or else built the propulsion system into the module itself (Zarya, Zvezda, Nauka).  Rassvet was delivered by the Shuttle. \\n So while Falcon Heavy clearly has the volume in the fairing they need a system other than the second stage to get up to the station. \\n SpaceX has demonstrated the ability to berth (get close, CanadArm2 grabs and docs) and dock (PMA only, so not useful) so they know how to get a vehicle close. And maybe they could adapt a Dragon's Draco system to be standalone for another module. \\n Similarly the Service Module of the Boeing Starliner might be adaptable.  The basic ideas in Cygnus is being used in somewhat of this fashion for the Gateway station so that might be the best bet for NASA. \\n But the US owns Zarya. They paid for it, way at the beginning of the ISS project. The design of Nauka is to be the base of a new station for Russia.  I.e. There is at least a design goal, to be able to separate from the ISS and with the Prichal module, form the core of a new station. \\n Thus the main need is for altitude and attitude control.  They just tested Cygnus recently for some of this purpose. There are technical reasons that are a bit beyond me as to why Cygnus cannot yet fulfill the entirety of this role, but it can do some of it. \\n Thus the real question is less, is there a way to launch a module, but more about how to get the module to the ISS and attached, and then can it fulfill the roles needed that the current Russian modules fulfill. \\n Axiom is planning to add new modules to the ISS in the next few years, so they may be already solving some of these issues. They too intend to start with the ISS and eventually detach as the ISS phases out and operate on their own.\",\n",

       "  'answer': \"I think the answer is probably no, but not for the reasons other answers give.  First of all we can ignore the whole multi-body problem: it's a really good approximation that the planets & Sun  run on rails since they are hugely more massive than the spacecraft.  let's also assume that modelling a trajectory between two points is tractable, whether or not you use continuous thrust or not (this could well be a reasonably hard optimisation problem to minimise fuel &c but I suspect that's very doable on a modern personal computer. \\n That's not what makes it hard: what makes it hard is that this is a search problem merely dressed up as a physics problem, and search problems, famously, have combinatorial explosions.  Search problems require machines like  Deep Blue  to solve them, and these things are definitely supercomputers (albeit specialised ones). \\n Why is is a search problem?  Well, because the way you get around the Solar System isn't in fact by computing a trajectory between two points, it's by computing a bunch of gravitational slingshots around other bodies in the Solar System.  And there are a large number of such possible trajectories, and the number increases, possibly exponentially, as you increase the number of slingshots.  And you can't deform the trajectories into each other to use any nice numerical solving approach because you keep crashing into planets since all these trajectories go rather close to planets. \\n Checking  a proposed trajectory is much easier: if I tell you the plan is to do a couple of assists around Venus, a course correction burn in deep space then an assist around Earth and one around Jupiter on the way to Saturn (this is what Cassini did) then you can pretty easily check the trajectory is OK and compute its fine details.  But  arriving  at such a trajectory is a different question.  This smells strongly of P and NP: given a solution it is easy to check, but arriving at a solution might be hard. \\n So this might actually be a computationally seriously demanding problem.  I think it probably  isn't  in fact, for a few reasons: there aren't very many objects you can use for slingshots so the search space doesn't explode too badly, and the mission duration is constrained as is fuel for course adjustments &c so you can prune solutions which take more time than you have or may need more fuel than you have.  I suspect that keeps the computation sane. \\n \\n [Note I'm posting this answer as a guest: I started writing it on the physics SE last night but the question got migrated & I don't belong to this SE.]\",\n",

I am going to argue that the  impactor  is known to be better. \\n Let's say you have a given spacecraft massing 1000 kg and capable of 1000 m/s  $\\\\Delta v$  in total maneuvers (by itself). I am neglecting propellant mass loss; adjust the initial spacecraft mass up if you need to include it to get a total momentum change of  $10^6$  kg m/s for the spacecraft. \\n For the sake of simplifying everything dramatically, you can use that  $\\\\Delta v$  either starting landed on the asteroid (this is a highball, since we're skipping everything needed to land on it), or to accelerate the spacecraft to a collision (and this is a lowball, since we're ignoring the velocity you already have relative to the asteroid on approach). \\n The pusher attaches to the asteroid and shoots  $10^6$  kg m/s in momentum of propellant off into space, imparting  $10^6$  kg m/s to the combined system — the same as it would do to itself, because now it's just pushing against a wall rather than into space. \\n The impactor picks up  $10^6$  kg m/s and then smacks into the asteroid, knocking loose a cloud of ejecta in mostly the opposite direction it came in (minus some angle losses). Which means the asteroid is receiving about  $10^6$  kg m/s (assuming it's much more massive) from the impactor  plus  some amount equal and opposite to the momentum of the thrown ejecta.  As was estimated in the aftermath of the DART impact , this multiplies the total transferred momentum by a factor of something like 2 to 5, depending on the composition and density of the target.\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'George Dyson (son of Freeman Dyson) wrote a rather nice book on  Project Orion , which amongst other things will disabuse you of the notion that this was a well funded and well received project (also it was not a NASA project, and I think it predates NASA. As Dyson tells it, a steel man cover was accidentally blown into space during an underground nuclear bomb test, which gave some people the idea that this might be a feasible way of propelling a space ship). \\n In any case, according to Dyson the Orion concept was supposed to work by having some propellant being turned into plasma by nuclear charges that were ignited at fixed intervals. For that you need a) a big pusher plate basically to be in the way of the expanding plasma and b) (for a crewed vehicle at last) a shock absorber arrangement that prevents the crew from being turned into goop by being subjected to sudden bursts vast acceleration every half second or so (having bombs explode under your butt is not as such a continuous process. You also would need few more accoutrements such as a very reliable ejector mechanism to place the bombs at the correct place at the correct time, but I\\'m not sure how much this would influence the shape of the contraption). \\n As I see it, this gives you basically a big round thing attached to a huge rod that travels up and down (unless a bomb misfires or is ignited at the wrong moment, which will probably make for a very interesting death. Also this is of course a comic book depiction of the shock absorber, but it demonstrates the principle) , which would severely limit your design choices for the rest of the vehicle (not sure if there is really a technical necessity for the pusher plate to be round, but you want it big because it shields the passenger compartment against overspill from the explosion). \\n Also you need room for bombs, a lot of them. I don\\'t have the book at hand, but if I recall correctly the estimate for the interstellar version was that it would take some 2,4 million nuclear charges in the kiloton range to get to Proxima Centauri within human lifetimes, and that did not include any braking.  \\n Some of the more stumpy designs seem to predate any actual work on the concept. I think we can safely say that any actual flying Project Orion-type spaceship would look rather different that those designs.  \\n There was a \"flight model\" in the bullet design (not using nuclear charges, but TNT), but as far as I can tell this would not have scaled to anything resembling a real-life spaceship. \\n Pointless bonus fact: There is an Alastair Reynolds novel that features a Project Orion-Type spacecraft that uses nuclear charges the size of a Coca Cola can. This was probably alluding to the fact (again, according to Dyson\\'s sources, who very well may be telling anecdotes) that the proposed mechanism for the bomb ejection was adapted from a Coca Cola vending machine.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Radial burn is usually preferred. \\n Axial burn rockets (solid rockets that burn from the bottom up – otherwise known as end burners) suffer from the problem that the centre of gravity of the rocket changes as the rocket burns. \\n Radial burn rockets do not tend to suffer from this problem as they mostly burn from the inside out along the length of the rocket. \\n The thrust of a solid rocket is dependent on the amount of propellant that burns in a given time and that is dependent on the geometry of the burn tube. A circular burn tube will provide less thrust for longer, a star shaped cross section will provide more thrust for a reduced period. An end burner has a much smaller circular burn surface. \\n Once lit it is not possible to throttle a solid rocket motor in the same way as a liquid propellant rocket.

       "  'answer': \"Minimizing propellant consumption is one of the key drivers in most space missions. Propellant, while obviously important, was not the top driving factor with regard to the Apollo program. The Apollo missions were suboptimal with regard to propellant consumption. It was the human crew and the life support for them that drove the fast timeline used in the Apollo program. \\n Regardless of the scientific and engineering goals of an Apollo era uncrewed mission, almost all such missions in the Apollo era had a key overarching goal: To support the manned Apollo missions in some way. To this end, many of the early uncrewed early lunar missions followed the fast trajectories that would later be used by the Apollo flights to ensure that the Apollo flights could succeed. \\n A Hohmann transfer (over five days, one-way, from LEO to the Moon's vicinity) would have been better with regard to propellant than were the trajectories used in the Apollo era. Some of the current missions to the Moon do use a Hohmann-like transfer. However, in many cases, even that is overkill. Given that LEO to the vicinity of the Moon is almost a factor of 60 in terms of orbital radius change, a bielleptic transfer is considerably more propellant efficient than is a Hohmann-like transfer. However, this takes even longer than a Hohmann-like transfer. It takes even longer than a bielliptic transfer to take advantage of various low-energy transfers. These low-energy transfers can can take several months (or even longer) to accomplish. The propellant savings are however, quite immense. \\n Those propellant savings can be used to make a mission less costly. They can also be used to enable improved but more massive payloads. It oftentimes makes more sense to use a low-and-slow transfer method if it doesn't particularly matter how long it takes a vehicle to get to the Moon.\",\n",

These are simple trajectories: easy to visualize and calculate. \\n Then,  Edward Belbruno  came up with an idea for a trajectory that would take longer, but use up to 25% less propellant: a  low-energy transfer . This was first tried in 1991, was successful, and is now the default for unmanned missions. These trajectories require complex math and are less obvious, so it's no surprise this class of trajectories was discovered later. \\n So these days, new missions have a choice: use a larger rocket to get to the moon quickly, or use a smaller rocket and spend months traveling to the moon instead of a few days. \\n Manned missions will tend to use the fast option, because you don't want your crew to wait for months. Unmanned missions can often afford to spend that time cruising, unless there's a specific reason to use a faster trajectory. Like Intuitive Machines: they use cryogenic propellants. A long mission would mean they'd have to make the spacecraft more complex to prevent that propellant from boiling off. Most unmanned spacecraft use hypergolic propellants which are stable liquids at room temperature, so it's much easier to store them long term.\",\n",

       "  'answer': \"(the following was too long for a comment, but should be seen as such, and not as an answer..) \\n You have to remember, or realize, that the ODS you see used for the Shuttle-ISS missions, essentially came about due to politics, and the Russians, and did not exist as the ODS before 1993. \\n \\n during latter Shuttle missions EVA airlock was placed in payload bay and used both for docking with ISS (with orbital docking system) \\n \\n Not enough interesting stuff to add to Organic Marble's great answer, though I wanted to add that ODS in the form you are familiar with only existed since the Shuttle-Mir missions which preceded Shuttle-ISS by a few years. \\n \\n ODS actually was Russian hardware, with its heritage traceable to in 1975's Apollo-Soyuz mission with the APAS-75 docking collar. \\n \\n In the Soviet space program they developed a shuttle (Buran) and needed a docking collar with which to dock to their space stations, which was Mir at the time. \\n \\n APAS-89, a development of APAS-75 was the result. \\n \\n At around the same time, Space Station Freedom was in development (hell), but after much bouncing around it had a docking system in development. \\n \\n Come post-1990 and the USSR was gone, Russia needed money and space tech was for sale. \\n \\n Early 1993, SSF was on the chopping block, after so many attempts to kill it off. \\n \\n In 1993 many things happened: Clinton brought on board Russia, resulting in approval for the space station to go forward and adding a Russian Orbital Segment; \\n \\n this also resulted in the propulsion module of the space station being removed as well as the docking system. Approval was because it was thought it would save money... \\n \\n In place of the propulsion system you had the Russian segment now providing that (through Zarya, Zvezda, Progress and Soyuz), and \\n \\n the docking system - well that was replaced by the Russian APAS-89 system that had been in development for the Mir-Buran docking missions (that ultimately never happened, but the docking hardware was ready to use on Mir). \\n \\n The name Space Station Freedom also disappeared, and ISS was in use by the end of that year. \\n \\n The first phase of the journey to US-Russian co-operating on the ISS was the Shuttle-Mir missions - and to facilitate the docking of the Orbiter to Mir, the Russian APAS-89 docking collar was used. \\n \\n Later, to stop moving one of the space station modules out of the way every time the Orbiter docked, they added a smaller module that was essentially a double ended APAS-89. By the time of the ISS missions, a modified APAS-89, APAS-95 was selected to be integrated in to the Orbiters ODS on the ISS missions. \\n \\n The later APAS ODS implementation meant the removal of the internal airlock, with only OV-102 not having that change made to her, making her the only Orbiter not able to dock with the ISS (IIRC, amongst other issues, like weight). \\n \\n \\n But if you go back in time to 1988-1992, when Space Station Freedom was in development, its docking system required the Orbiter's airlock to be in place. \\n \\n SSF's dual docking system had a tunnel that extended into the Payload Bay, with its external framework attaching to points within the Payload Bay and connected to the Orbiters internal airlock, giving the crew a sleeveless working environment from Orbiter to Space Station Freedom. \\n History and adapting the Russians into the ODS (92-93-onwards) eliminated that system. \\n \\n So... \\n \\n early Shuttle missions orbiter EVA airlock was placed inside the Crew Cabin (next to entry to payload bay) and they made spacewalks through this entry to the payload bay.  Where was then ODS (orbital docking system) placed on missions with internal airlocks ? \\n \\n Simply put, it didn't exist at the time: \\n \\n ISS, as we know it now existed only from 1993, and \\n the first version was built for the Shuttle-Mir missions, and \\n before that, the Orbiters were expected to connect to Space Station Freedom via a different method, using its internal airlock. \\n \\n Early on there was another idea explored: the Spacehab module (shorter module than Spacelab and was already in use) was to be attached to SSF permanently and the Orbiter would maneuver the module to attach inside its Payload Bay and dock that way. \\n Some old links that were interesting reading: \\n https://www.americaspace.com/2015/06/20/houston-atlantis-we-have-capture-20-years-since-the-first-shuttle-mir-docking-mission-part-1/ \\n \\n the Soviet bloc was on the brink of political collapse and the risk of Russia haemorrhaging technology to undesirable locations, such as Iran, prompted the United States to foster co-operation in space. \\n September 1993, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin agreed to initiate “Phase One” of ISS co-operation, through the Shuttle-Mir Program, which would involve 21 months of total U.S. astronaut time aboard the space station. \\n By December, the U.S., European, Japanese, and Canadian elements of the ISS—which formerly constituted the bones of Space Station Freedom—had been merged with Russia’s planned Mir-2. \\n \\n https://www.americaspace.com/2015/06/21/houston-atlantis-we-have-capture-20-years-since-the-first-shuttle-mir-docking-mission-part-2/ \\n \\n the Spacelab module in the shuttle's payload bay was activated, \\n as was the 95.2 million Orbiter Docking System (ODS), which would be utilized to physically link up with Mir. \\n The development of the ODS got underway in July 1992, shortly after the Shuttle-Mir docking mission was first defined, and within 19 months it had progressed through preliminary and critical design reviews on both the U.S. and Russian sides. \\n The docking mechanism, known as the Androgynous Peripheral Docking System (APDS), was manufactured by Russia's Energia design bureau in Kaliningrad, under an $18 million subcontract signed in June 1993, and was based on an original design which might have been used by the ill-fated Soviet shuttle, Buran. \\n Rockwell International, the shuttle’s prime contractor, accepted delivery of the Russian-built hardware from Energia in September 1994 and set to work integrating it into the ODS.\",\n",

I choose the latter interpretation because it allows physical realization of the idea. \\nSo it is completely practical to recycle the rocket exhaust. It need not be hydrogen and oxygen propellant. It could be methane and oxygen at a ratio of perhaps 3 kg oxygen to 1 kg methane in which case you should get exhaust gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. [Ben Munro, Mechanical Engineer] ( https://www.benjaminmunro.com/liquid-oxygen-methane-engine-development ) \\nCarbon dioxide can be converted back to methane using hydrogen in the Sabatier reaction. [The renaissance of the Sabatier reaction and its applications on Earth and in space]  ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-019-0244-4 ) Carbon monoxide can also be converted to methane with hydrogen, a catalyst, pressure and heat.  [\"Adsorption and Desorption of Hydrogen, Carbon Monoxide, and Their Reaction Products on a Catalyst for the Synthesis of Methanol\" by C. AHARONI and H. STARE] ( https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/v74-603 ).  Hydrogen can be recovered from water vapor by electrolysis.  Recovery of hydrogen by electrolysis is an essential part of the recycling effort and it requires electrical power and time. \\nThe suggestion to recycle rocket exhaust and a suggestion of how to do it has appeared on the internet.  [RECYCLING ROCKET EXHAUST] ( https://lunarpedia.org/w/RECYCLING_ROCKET_EXHAUST )  I hesitate to offer this reference because I posted the Lunarpedia article so it is no more authoritative than I am but it shows that I am not plagiarizing.  Of the physical possibility of capturing and recycling rocket exhaust, there is no doubt.  It does not require an engineering degree such as I have to understand the concepts involved.  Construction of a thirty mile long tube on the surface of the Earth\\'s moon along the equator through which tube a rocket accelerates at 30 meters per second squared to orbit velocity would allow the capturing of most of the exhaust by closing the door after the rocket leaves.  Horizontal acceleration to orbital velocity was the first means suggested by Sir Isaac Newton.  [Newton\\'s Orbital Cannon] ( http://www.astronautix.com/n/newtonsorbitalcannon.html#:~:text=Newton\\'s%20Orbital%20Cannon&text=British%20gun%2Dlaunched%20orbital%20launch,for%20space%20travel%20and%20rocketry. ). \\nVertical launches on the moon have the advantage that ullage thrust is provided by gravity.  When a rocket is to be launched horizontally within a tube, electro magnetic launch assist by an electrically accelerated mobile launching pad can provide ullage while keeping the rocket in the tube.  The electric launch assist also can provide 4% of mission delta v. \\nSince there has been no such rocket exhaust recycling facility built the percentage of propellant that could be recovered and reused by the original rocket after it returns or by another rocket is not well known.  I offer a guess that a real facility could recycle better than 95% of the expended propellant.  If the minority of the fuel that gets lost is replaced, a rocket could make repeated trips back and forth between two fuel recycling fuel depots and use the same fuel over and over again.',\n",

       "  'answer': \"The exhaust from a liquid-hydrogen liquid-oxygen rocket contains a great deal of unburnt hydrogen. The stochiometric mix is 8:1 by mass but such rockets run at closer to 5:1 for maximum specific impulse. The unburnt hydrogen adds thrust because it exits at very high velocity (high momentum) due to its low mass (compared with water vapor). \\n It is tempting to try to use the unburnt hydrogen in some way, but any attempt to bring along the extra oxygen is doomed to failure both because of the need to carry that extra oxygen and the need to somehow match its speed with the unburnt hydrogen in the exhaust.

       "  'answer': 'No, it would not be practical to do that. \\n It is theoretically possible to convert exhaust into fuel back again. I know rockets use different fuel/oxidizer compounds, like for example hydrazine and its derivatives oxidized by dinitrogen tetroxide, but let\\'s consider a simpler example since the conclusion also holds if applied to all other fuel and oxidizer duos. If we used liquid hydrogen as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidizer, the product of the combustion is going to be water vapor. It is totally possible to convert the water back into hydrogen and oxygen. \\n However, the problem with such approach is more fundamental: conversion of combustion products back into substrates (fuel and oxidizer) will require energy input, and more importantly, considering the second law of thermodynamics, it will always require more energy than was obtained from the combustion in the first place. Net result of energy gained vs spent will necessarily be always negative, no matter what method is used to split water into its constituting elements. \\n Any supposed solution to this fundamental problem would have to violate the laws of physics. And contrary to claims made in some other answers, it is not necessarily hard nor complicated to turn exhaust back into fuel and oxidizer. All water electrolysis requires is two electrodes and a source of electricity with voltage above around 1.23 V; optional, but highly recommended would also be a little amount of strong and electrolytically inert ionic compound like sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to increase the rate of reaction. The process itself is really simple, does not require any \"cutting-edge\" (or whatever buzzword is trendy nowadays) technology and potentially anybody could conduct such process at home right now. And given sufficiently long time, even the products of wood combustion (assuming complete combustion to carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash) will in some sense partly turn back into wood and oxygen, as growing trees absorb those substances back from air and the ground while undergoing photosynthesis. Such claims could suggest that it could be possible, but difficult and requiring the invention of some innovative technology, while it actually is possible, just would net energy loss and thus not make sense. \\n It also does not matter what method of reacting hydrogen with oxygen is used: combustion, inverse electrolysis in so called \"fuel cell\", etc. will always yield less energy than will be required to turn the resulting water back into hydrogen and oxygen. \\n A famous series of old pictures from 2010 shows a different, but similar in principle, impossible concept (click on pictures to see full-size versions):',\n",

       " {'question': \"Why do rockets keep going up instead of down or right or left into space?\\nWhy can't the rockets go down or left or right to get to space if the earth is in the shape of a sphere?\",\n",
       "  'answer': \"Short answer: Because of that pesky atmosphere (and mountains too) \\n Longer answer: You can get into space in any direction as long as nothing is in the way. If you go horizontal, in most places you'll hit something hard like a mountain which will slow you down pretty quickly (called lithobreaking in the community) which usually leads to a RUD (Rapid, unscheduled disassembly) of your vehicle. \\n If you have a large enough area in front of you (nothing hard obstructing the view to the horizon) you can theoretically take off horizontally. There are a few caveats tough: \\n Gravity and Atmosphere: \\n If you don't want to stay on the ground, you'll need a speed that makes the centripetal (please correct me if I used the wrong word here) force of your vehicle going around the curvature of earth to be bigger than gravity. At earths radius and gravity that's around 7.9km/s or 28440km/h. That's pretty fast. That's so fast, the the air gets compressed in front of your vehicle and rapidly heats up forming a plasma (same thing you see when an orbital vehicle reenters earths atmosphere). The energy to compress that air and heat it up must come from somewhere and that's your engine. You need a ridiculous amount of energy just to push trough the atmosphere and now you're just following the curvature of the earth at whatever level you started until you hit something hard. If you want to go off into space, you need to be faster! \\n So we should get rid of that pesky atmosphere. the easiest way to do that is to go to a place, where there is no (or only a negligible  amount of) atmosphere. The biggest place where there is almost no atmosphere is space. \\n So that's why rockets go straight up first: to leave that pesky atmosphere behind as fast as possible to they don't ways the precious fuel trying to compress and heat up a lot of air but to use it to get into orbit. \\n Would it be feasible to lift off horizontally from a body without atmosphere then? \\n Is always: it depends! On the moon landings it wasn't feasible because they did not have well prepared surface of sufficient length to accelerate to orbital velocity horizontally. But in my opinion (correct me if I'm wrong) it would be the most economic way to reach orbit because you don't get any gravity loss (but building such a runway on the moon is probably not feasible for the next few hundred years). \\n Would it be feasible on smaller bodies like asteroids? Yes and no. If the escape velocity is only a few meters per second that can be reached with a short puff from the engine, building a long runway doesn't seem economical. But maybe in the future? Taking off of an asteroid with only the help of ion thrusters? Maaaaaybe?\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'I\\'m not sure what you mean by \"go down\" to get into space, hopefully it\\'s obvious that the earth is in the way to prevent going straight down? \\n To get into space you need to reach an altitude of around 100km (depending on your favourite definition of \"space\", there\\'s no defined line, just fairly arbitrary choices of where the atmosphere is thin enough for normal aerodynamics to not apply anymore and you have to maneuver with rockets only), the shortest path to this altitude is to go straight up. \\n To stay in space you need to get into orbit, to get into orbit you need to achieve a minimum speed of around 28,000 km/h and this speed needs to be in a direction (approximately) parallel to the surface of the earth. Therefore to get onto orbit you do mostly need to go sideways, not up, most of the rockets energy is expended getting horizontal velocity, not gaining vertical altitude (i.e. they do go \"left\" or \"right\"). \\n An orbital launch is all about getting to the final orbit you want, using the minimum fuel, with the maximum amount of payload. Rockets could go straight up to get into space and only once they\\'re in space, turn sideways and start speeding up, this wouldn\\'t be very efficient however as you\\'d have spent a long time getting up, and spent a lot of fuel. You could start going sideways straight away, but getting above even the speed of sound (1200km/h) is tricky at ground level, getting to over 20 times the speed of sound is very difficult indeed, the drag of the atmosphere would constantly be slowing you down and heating up the vehicle, requiring lots of extra fuel. \\n The optimal path to space ends up being to go (nearly) straight up first to escape the thickest part of the atmosphere then to turn to the side to start gaining horizontal velocity. If you watch a rocket launch you\\'ll hear them mention \"max-Q\" near the beginning of the flight, this is where the aerodynamic stress is at a maximum from going fast, low in the atmosphere, past this point even though the rocket continues to accelerate the stress reduces as the altitude increases and the atmosphere gets thinner. If rockets didn\\'t go up first, max-Q would be higher and the rocket would need to be stronger (and therefore heavier) to survive the stress. A heavier rocket means there\\'s less spare mass available for payload.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The explanation of nozzles working by decreasing the velocity of flow is not correct. Nozzles ALWAYS accelerate the flow passing through them. One must first understand what kind of flow is passing through the nozzle. If the nozzle inlet flow is moderately subsonic, the flow will accelerate at the nozzle throat (the minimum area) and impart the highest momentum to the gas. Since thrust is based largely on momentum, no expansion downstream of the throat is necessary (just look at commercial jet engine nozzles) and the gas is expelled to the atmosphere. It also holds that the gas pressure will be its lowest at the throat. Now if the nozzle inlet flow speed is high enough, the flow will accelerate to Mach 1 at the throat. In this case, the flow becomes supersonic and things happen in reverse. In supersonic flow, expanding area causes acceleration and pressure drop, opposite to that for subsonic flow. So after the flow reaches Mach 1 at the throat, an expanding area is needed downstream to further accelerate it. This is why nozzles expand and do so in such a way so as to achieve a desired exit velocity. As for the internal pressure distribution inside the supersonic nozzle, it continues to drop over the length of the nozzle downstream of the throat. Again, this is opposite to what happens for subsonic flow. The pressure forces provide some thrust, but not much. The pressure component of thrust is relatively insignificant compared to the momentum contribution from the accelerated flow. And incidentally, except for detonation-based engines, the nozzle inlet flow from any engine (jet or rocket) is always subsonic. \\n This statement about nozzle expansion, however, is correct enough for this audience: \\n \\n In designing the nozzle of real rockets, there is a balance to be struck; at lower altitude, the atmospheric pressure is higher, so the best nozzle shape would widen less than a nozzle for use in space.',\n",

Totality's ground track is not necessarily a great circle (unlike a LEO). \\n This means you will get a poor match between the totality ground track and any LEO (unless the totality happens to pass through the subsolar point). \\n If you want to maximize time in totality, you are better off using high speed aircraft than a LEO orbit. \\n However, if you are dreaming of space tourism, you can dream big and go above LEO. It opens other opportunities. \\n Travelling near the tip of the umbra provides only a brief eclipse, as opposed to travelling through a wide portion of the umbra at the same speed.

       "  'answer': \"You are making some terrible mistakes. I want to point out right from the start that pressure thrust and momentum thrust as you describe them are not two separate contributors, they are equal. They are both expressions of the same thing, and they should not be counted twice! \\n Now on to your question. \\n The largest contributor to a rocket engines thrust is the chamber pressure acting on a throat sized patch on the injector face. If you did your estimation by multiplying the chamber pressure by the throat area and then adding the exit pressure multiplied by the remaining nozzle exit area, you would get a much closer answer! \\n But the simplest way to estimate a rocket's thrust is with the thrust coefficient: \\n $$F = c_fP_cA_t = \\\\dot{m}v_e +\\\\left(P_e -P_a \\\\right)A_e = \\\\int P_x ~dA$$ \\n You see that the thrust ( $F$ ) is directly proportional to the product of chamber pressure ( $P_c$ ) and throat area ( $A_t$ ). But it is not one-to-one. It is scaled by the thrust coefficient ( $c_f$ ). I also include here the classic rocket thrust equation that breaks down into a momentum term ( $\\\\dot{m}v_e$ ) and a pressure term ( $\\\\Delta PA_e)$ .  When you hear someone refer to 'pressure' thrust and 'momentum thrust', these are the terms they are talking about (and they are indeed different from one another) . \\n The pressure thrust you describe (i.e. the integrated axial pressure force acting on the engine walls) I include at the end of that equation. You can see that it is directly equal to the thrust. To be precise, the integral there is the physical accounting for thrust, and the middle equation accounts for the momentum that must be imparted into the exhaust by the pressure distribution. The conservation of momentum tells us these are equal, but it is much easier to measure, meter, and compute momentum than pressure distributions because the former has no dependance on geometry. Note that the pressure integral must be evaluated on the inside and outside of the engine! \\n For a more detailed breakdown about the equality between the momentum based and pressure based thrust formulations, check out  this answer. \\n Let us return to the thrust coefficient and the lunar ascent module. The thrust coefficient accounts for unideal expansion. I give a detailed breakdown of its calculation  in this answer.  The values you gave for throat and exit area give an expansion ratio of 45.7, this paired with a vacuum ambient pressure gives a thrust coefficient of about 1.9. \\n With the thrust coefficient, we can finally (and simply)  compute the thrust as 1.9 multiplied by 120 psi multiplied by 16.4 square inches, giving 3,740 pounds of thrust.  This is very close to wikipedia's cited thrust value of 3,500 pounds. The delta could easily be explained by the fact that I haphazardly picked the thrust coefficient off a chart computed with inappropriate gas properties. If you compute the thrust coefficient specifically for this engine, the answer would become more precise. \\n A final note!  You cannot just assume that the pressure ratio across the nozzle will be equal to the area ratio!  Though the linked questions touch on that aspect, so I will leave it at that. \\n Just kidding, I will address the center of thrust question. The pressure distributions in most rocket engines are mostly axisymmetric, placing the center of thrust colinear with the engines symmetry axis. In any case, an integral of the pressure force will give a resultant vector that will tell you the location and direction of the net thrust. If you'd like to play around without doing truly nasty integrations, you might look into the equations for center of gravity and draw an analogy between mass and pressure.\",\n",

       "  'answer': \"Orbit (EDIT: more like escape velocity) \\n Well, kind of. Gas is similar to anything in space: if it's in orbit, it won't come down until the atmosphere or solar radiation decays it's trajectory enough. But no matter what, it will settle onto the top of the atmosphere if it stays in orbit. If it escapes the Earth's gravitational pull then it will never come down.  \\n It's not necessarily a matter of altitude, but more of the orbital trajectory of the particles. \\n As for the crossover value, it depends on the engine, namely its exhaust velocity and plume dispersion, as well as the ascent profile of the rocket. So the answer is that there isn't really any set threshold that will define, for all rockets on LP-1/LOX or any other fuel combination, when 50% of the exhaust will fall back to Earth and 50% will not. It is entirely dependent on the particular rocket launch. \\n EDIT: \\n Let me rethink my answer... \\n Let's assume a Merlin 1D from SpaceX as an example, running on kerosene and oxygen. \\n In a vacuum, Merlin 1D has a specific impulse of 311 seconds, so our exhaust velocity $v_e=g_0\\\\times I_{sp}$, so about 3,050 m/s.  \\n If the rocket is at the end of its orbital insertion burn into LEO, then it will be traveling at orbital velocity, 7,800 m/s. If the exhaust leaves the engine the other way at 3,050 m/s, then the final velocity of the exhaust would be 4750 m/s, well under orbital velocity. It will be recaptured by the atmosphere. \\n If the exhaust is to leave the Earth forever, then it must be traveling away from Earth at escape velocity, 11,200 m/s, and then some to account for other forces. That means that the rocket itself must be traveling at escape velocity plus the exhaust velocity: 14,250 m/s. The rocket must be well on its way out of the Earth's gravitational influence if it is to stay in space.  \\n Again, this leads to the same answer that there is no practical 50%.

Please for the love of all that is holy, use effective exhaust velocity instead. \\n Impulse by itself makes sense. You measure it in Newton-seconds, or poundforce-seconds. It\\'s the integral of the force the engine generates vs time. For an ideal constant-thrust engine, it\\'s that constant thrust times the burn time. If you hook up a tank twice as big to the same engine, this doubles the impulse. You can run the total impulse through a close analog of the rocket equation to get delta-v directly from impulse. \\n But how do we compare a Space Shuttle booster with the E9-6 engine in my model rocket? Sure the booster has a thousand tons of thrust, but it weighs 500 tons by itself. So we divide by the mass of the propellant used to get specific impulse. This makes lots of sense, since we get some kind of efficiency reading. You get more impulse out of one kilogram of hydrogen and oxygen than you do out of one kilogram of modern solid propellant, and a  lot  more than from one kilogram of black powder. \\n So if the units of impulse are newton-seconds and the units of mass are kilograms, you get a unit for specific impulse of newton-seconds per kilogram. Nothing wrong with that, makes perfect sense. \\n The issue comes up when you use pounds force and pounds mass. You end up with poundforce-seconds per poundmass.

You can do the same thing with SI, you just have to use kilograms-force instead of newtons as your unit of force. Then you get so many kilogramforce-seconds of impulse per kilogrammass of propellant, and have the same temptation to cancel the different kinds of kilograms. We just customarily use Newtons in SI, since Newtons are the one and only SI unit of force. Kilograms-force are an abomination that so far I\\'ve only seen SpaceX use, and then they usually talk about tons of force where a ton is 1000kg. \\n Whenever we try to rationalize specific impulse in seconds, we end up talking about how long you can burn 1 pound of fuel to get 1 pound of thrust. It\\'s a  cursed   unit . \\n All of this hides some interesting and important physics, that comes for free just by analyzing the units of specific impulse: \\n $$\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\n\\\\frac{N\\\\cdot s}{kg}&=&\\\\frac{kg\\\\cdot m}{s^2}\\\\frac{s}{kg} & \\\\text{(expand N in base units)}\\\\\\\\\\n&=&(kg)(m)(s^{-2})(s)(kg^{-1}) & \\\\text{(separate all terms)}\\\\\\\\\\n&=&(kg)(kg^{-1})(m)(s^{-2})(s) & \\\\text{(group kg terms and s terms)}\\\\\\\\\\n&=&(m)(s^{-2})(s) & \\\\text{(cancel kg terms)}\\\\\\\\\\n&=&\\\\frac{m}{s} & \\\\text{(cancel s terms and get speed!)}\\\\end{eqnarray}$$ \\n And at the end we are left with a speed, and not just any speed. This is the speed you need to throw stuff out the back in order to generate the required force. This is a physically present and important concept. If your engine has an effective exhaust velocity of 4000m/s and is operated in space, the exhaust will be 4km away in one second. \\n The only reason we call it  effective  exhaust velocity is that some of the flow is slower because of things like turbulence in the jet or friction against the nozzle, but conversely some of the jet is faster. It really is the \"average\" exhaust velocity. \\n Now, if you divide 4000m/s by 9.80665m/s^2, you get the conventional ~408 \"seconds\" of specific impulse. The reason  $g_0$  is there is because that\\'s the conversion factor between kilograms-force and kilograms-mass. Earth\\'s gravity exerts exactly  $g_0$  Newtons of force on each kilogram of mass. Conversely if you stick to pure US customary units, the exhaust velocity will be about 12000 feet per second, and you have to divide by  $g_0$ =about 32 feet per second squared. That  $g_0$  in feet per second is the conversion between pounds force and the US customary unit of mass  slug  which no one actually uses. In either case since this is just a conversion factor, we use the nominal value for the surface of the Earth rather than the actual gravity at any point in the trajectory. \\n So if someone gives you a specification where the specific impulse is in \"seconds\" you just divide by the appropriate  $g_0$  to get exhaust velocity, and use that whenever you use the rocket equation, just as is explained in other answers. \\n We only use specific impulse as \"seconds\" because it is conventional, but conventions can change. With your help, we can stomp out the menace of specific impulse and proclaim the gospel of effective exhaust velocity.',\n",

       "  'answer': \"The US uses, and I'll be blunt, goofy units. The US definition of specific impulse explicitly uses  $g_0$  to convert the effective exhaust velocity to units of time. Other places simply use the effective exhaust velocity as the measure of specific impulse. \\n There are times when specific impulse measured in units of time makes a modicum of sense. Those times are launch from a planet whose surface gravitational acceleration is close to  $g_0$ . Specific impulse, in units of time, yields a rough estimate of how long a well-fueled set of engines can fire. There are times when measuring mass in units of pounds-mass and force in units of pounds-force make a modicum of sense. Once again, this is launch from a planet whose surface gravitational acceleration is close to  $g_0$ . A launch vehicle with a total mass of one hundred thousand pounds needs an engine (or set of engines) with a launch force of at least one hundred thousand pounds. \\n In space, it makes much more sense to use consistent units so we can write  $F=ma$  rather than  $F=kma$ , where  $k$  is a non-unitary and non-unitless scale factor that is needed to make Newton's second law work due to the use of inconsistent units. Note that using consistent units does not merely make the scale factor  $k$  have a numerical value of one. It is a very strong statement that force is not an independent unit. Force is mass times acceleration, period. \\n Similarly, in space it makes much more sense to use effective exhaust velocity as the measure of specific impulse rather than effective exhaust velocity divided by  $g_0$ . When specific impulse is expressed in units of length over time (i.e., effective exhaust velocity), the ideal rocket equation has no dependence on  $g_0$ .\",\n",

As in all engineering fields, certain physical properties are desired in a particular alloy. \\n Mechanical properties are numerous, and most can be derived from elastic moduli. Some mechanical properties may or may not be particularly desirable for the particular part in question. Hardness, which is a value obtained from a simple experimental characterization technique, may also be important, depending upon how the part is used. \\n Weight is always important in this field, but it may not be first priority, in terms of physical properties. The engineer may be desiring resistance to shear, break, or bend over weight for a part such as a joint or fastener. For structural components, low weight may take priority, but some structural strength threshold may still be a deal-breaker. \\n Metallurgists spend most of their careers studying different alloys for just the right physical properties for a given situation. All alloys have different structural strengths, different levels of resistance to corrosion, different weights, etc, and depending upon the application, these properties have to be prioritized and the alloy is engineered appropriately.',\n",

Bending a hardened probe was impossible.

There is no checklist for getting an alloy of anything to be called aerospace grade.  There is no sign like at Disneyland saying \"your alloy must have at least XX strength to weight ratio to be aerospace grade\".  There is no rule that says how precisely controlled any additives or process must be (other than the spec for that material) to be \"aerospace\". \\n edit by BradV: there is a small caveat required here. From time to time a specific project might discover that an existing well defined alloy performs more to their needs if they more closely control one or more constituent alloying elements. This might take the form of specifying instead of standard nickel content of 5% +/- 2% we want nickel at 6% +/- 1% and we are willing to pay the price for this tailoring. We will buy this material to our specification XXX-YYYY. \\n All modern materials are specified in standards such as ASTM, ASME, ASE, Mil-Stds, MS standards. Anyone (yes, anyone!)  can call out any of these material/alloy requirements on an engineering specification/drawing. Just because a material has a specification and you \\'require it\\' on a part does not mean you actually GET that exact material. \\n The trick is to make sure you get the exactly right material properties today, next week, next year, in 10 years.  Unless you procure from a high quality certified provider you are likely to get what CLAIMS to be the same material but can vary widely from nominal values.  Straying widely from nominal can destroy aircraft/spaceships/satellites. \\n You might design/build/test/flight-qualify a project this year. Next year the production build begins and the materials might be bought from a different mill or even a different country. In ten years you are still building more and more of the same item.

What happens is combustion in the preburner increases the temperature of combustion gas but this translates into a greater volume of exhaust gas because the cross sectional area of the exhaust manifold is larger than the cross sectional area of the inlet manifolds so the pressure in the preburner is still lower than the pump. The energy of the preburner exhaust is quite high and some of it is captured by the turbine to turn the pump.',\n",

       " {'question': 'How does a closed-cycle rocket engine keep the chamber pressure from stalling the pump turbine?\\nI was thinking about how a closed-cycle rocket engine works, and I have a question about how the turbine can keep running. \\n  \\n As I understand it, once the engine is up and running, the pressure in the combustion chamber creates back-pressure on the fuel and oxidizer lines, which the pumps have to overcome to force reactants into the chamber. In an open-cycle, this is provided by a preburner that runs a gas turbine and then dumps the partially burned exhaust overboard (into an environment that\\'s, at most, at 1 atmosphere of pressure). \\n But for a closed-cycle, the fuel goes from the pump through the preburner, through the gas turbine that powers the pumps, and then into the chamber against all that back-pressure. So doesn\\'t that put the whole pump system into a sort of \"by your own bootstraps\" situation? You have to spin the turbine to turn the pump to spin the turbine.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'At least in the Space Shuttle Main Engine, the high-pressure pump turbines didn\\'t stall because the preburners operated at much, much higher pressure than the main combustion chamber. \\n The preburners were at ~5000 psi (~35 MPa) while the main combustion chamber was at \"only\" ~3000 psi (~21 MPa). \\n  \\n Source:  http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/nguyen1/docs/SSME_PRESENTATION.pdf  (highlighting mine) \\n The \"bootstrap\" situation you describe mainly was a factor in starting the engine. I don\\'t know if this is the focus of your question so I won\\'t go into too much detail, but the start sequence was a highly choreographed open-loop affair. The relevant parts here are the order in which the three combustion chambers primed and then ignited, initially driven by pressure from the External Tank.

       "  'answer': 'SpinLaunch isn\\'t the first \\n The concept of  Non-Rocket Spacelaunch  is older than the concept of rockets, since Jules Verne\\'s  From the Earth to the Moon  posited a massive cannon for the purpose in 1865, long before the idea of expendable rockets had first been discussed. That concept is now referred to as a \"Space Gun\", or sometimes a \"Verne Cannon\". \\n There are many, many concepts for various kinds of launch system that don\\'t use an expendable rocket or replace the first stage rocket with a more exotic system, all with various problems and limitations. \\n Mass Drivers \\n Some of the more reasonable options are electromagnetic launchers of various types. The general term is \"mass driver\". Most mass driver concepts are basically a very long coilgun or linear motor track that accelerates a launch vehicle, either as a first stage or as a sort of magnetic Verne cannon that can loft an entirely unpowered vehicle into space. \\n The limitations of a mass driver are the length of the launch track and air resistance, which is why mass drivers are mostly discussed as a possibility for cheap  lunar  launches. On the moon, air isn\\'t an issue, open space is ample, and the lower orbital velocity makes for a shorter track. Unmanned cargo could launch under accelerations of tens of G or more (but still far short of the many thousands of G that Spinlaunch cargo has to endure), while human launches could be possible with relatively moderate forces. A vehicle could launch into Lunar orbit with a small engine to circularize the orbit, or with good timing, a mass driver could throw a cargo pod into an earth-return orbit with no fuel usage at all.',\n",

At these speeds, heating from air friction would be like re-entry, but worse since the ground level atmosphere is thicker. The launch vehicle would burn up, break up, slow down, or all three at once. \\n Spin Launch (and some other strategies) launch at suborbital speed to avoid burning up, then accelerate in the upper atmosphere with rockets or ram jets \\n The approach of using a gun to launch a rocket projectile has been pursued by the military. \\n Some artillery shells are gun-launched but rocket assisted, known as rocket-assisted projectiles (RAP).

       "  'answer': 'The list of non-rocket space launch systems is very long including  Mass drivers ,  orbital rings ,  rotovators ,  lofstrom loops ,  space fountains ,  space towers ,  tethered rings ,  dark sky station ,  space Elevator ,  beam-powered ships  and so much more. \\n However, since you are asking about methods of \"throwing\" things into space, one interesting concept is the  rotating skyhook . Essentially, it’s a spinning tether or cable in orbit that can fling spacecrafts to higher velocities. \\n  \\n You can picture it like a car wheel on the road: the part of the wheel touching the ground isn’t moving relative to the ground, while the top of the wheel is moving at twice the speed of the car itself. Similarly, if a spacecraft docks at the bottom of the rotating skyhook, it can be flung, gaining additional speed. \\n To ensure the spacecraft doesn’t destabilize the skyhook by causing it to rotate around its center of mass, the skyhook\\'s center of mass has to be positioned on the opposite end of the cable. This can be achieved by attaching a counterweight, like a space station, a small asteroid, or another celestial object. \\n In space the skyhook would transfer its rotational energy into kinetic energy and accelerate the spacecraft, but after repeated use, the skyhook’s rotation would slow down. To maintain its spin, incoming spacecraft can transfer their kinetic energy back to the skyhook. This is like an orbital battery. Instead of wasting all your kinetic energy into thermal energy during reentry, it can be re-used for the next spacecraft taking off.',\n",

       "  'answer': \"Yes. There's quite a few other ideas out there: \\n Space Gun \\n This is what it sounds like, using some form of gun to launch things into space. Space Guns haven't sent anything to orbit yet, but in  Project HARP  a 410 mm (16 in) 100 caliber gun was used to fire a 180 kg (400 lb) projectile at 3,600 m/s (12,960 km/h; 8,050 mph), and it reached space, getting all the way up to 180 km (110 mi). \\n Ram Accelerator \\n The idea of this is that the projectile is fired using something else (such as the Space Gun idea from above) and then accelerated using jet engine-like systems. Ram Accelerators have not been used/tested very much. \\n Slingatron \\n According to Wikipedia: \\n \\n In a slingatron, projectiles are accelerated along a rigid tube or track that typically has circular or spiral turns, or combinations of these geometries in two or three dimensions. A projectile is accelerated in the curved tube by propelling the entire tube in a small-amplitude circular motion of constant or increasing frequency without changing the orientation of the tube, i.e. the entire tube gyrates but does not spin. An everyday example of this motion is stirring a beverage by holding the container and moving it in small horizontal circles, causing the contents to spin, without spinning the container itself. \\n \\n \\n This gyration continually displaces the tube with a component along the direction of the centripetal force acting on the projectile, so that work is continually done on the projectile as it advances through the machine. The centripetal force experienced by the projectile is the accelerating force, and is proportional to the projectile mass and inversely proportional to the track's radius of curvature. \\n \\n \\n A slingatron is capable of much higher velocities than a similar circular launcher based on a rotating tether made of currently available materials (e.g. Dyneema). The maximum tip velocity of a rotating tether, irrespective of its absolute scale, is limited by the strength to weight ratio of its materials, as the tether must support its own mass under centripetal acceleration as well as that of the projectile. In the slingatron, the projectile's centrifugal force is instead reacted into a nonrotating structure which can be as massive as necessary.\",\n",

Purely in terms of converting a given amount of energy (chemical rocket or solar powered ion rocket) into asteroid delta-v, is one strategy inherently more efficient than the other ? \\n Complications: \\n \\n The two strategies have different intercept strategies.

A soft landing at one of the poles would not be hampered by rotation. Thrust would then be limited to the direction of the axis, but for the purpose of re-direction to avoid Earth collision, any thrust direction will work. \\n \\n \\n But this question just deals with asteroid redirection via momentum transfer.
