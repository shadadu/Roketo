INTRODUCTION \\nThe author, along with the support of the Structures and Dynamics Laboratory, has made a major \\nthrust to develop criteria, design guidelines, and \"lessons learned\" as a part of an effort to provide \\nmentorship and to transfer knowledge to new NASA employees. A study of the problems experienced is \\na part of that effort. These criteria and guidelines should not become the layering of old laws or additional \\nlaws to protect against a failure or problems experienced, but should be overarching principles and \\nguidelines that allow for creativity, innovation, and accountability by each and every member of a \\ndesign and operations group. The study of problems serves as a basis for developing these high-level \\nprinciples that guide the development of future programs. Problem study is not to be the negative finger \\npointing \"look what you have done wrong,\" but the beacon to illuminate \"what to know and understand \\nin order to build low-cost, robust aerospace systems of the future.\"'}],\n",

       "   'answer': \"This paper is an attempt to establish part of this needed knowledge foundation. It is based on \\nmany years of experience in both the early and present years of space exploration. This study is an \\nexpansion of information published in references 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is presented with the faith that some \\nwill be challenged to launch out into the deep. Only to the degree that the individuals of the aerospace \\ncommunity launch out into the depth of their specialties, yet maintain a bend toward being a generalist, \\nan integrator, or a systemist, will the technology of the future aerospace (and possibly our Nation's) be served.\"}],\n",
       " [{'question': 'What is the scope of the paper?',\n",
       "   'answer': \"The information presented has many sources. Much of it was developed by the various vehicle or \\nspacecraft contractors. The information was obtained in general from briefings; however, some came \\nfrom reports and papers (see reference list). The remainder of the information was produced by NASA \\nengineers as they performed their tasks of managing the various project contracts, or conducting \\nresearch and technology development. Given the vast scope of this paper, it is impossible to credit all \\nthe individuals who contributed; however, it is they, and not the author, who did the work, had the \\ninsight, solved the problems. The author's task has been to collect the information and draw lessons \\nfrom it. The author has been involved in all the projects presented, as well as most of the specific \\nproblems discussed. Therefore, the selection is generally limited to the author's experiences and does \\nnot cover all NASA or Department of Defense (DOD) aerospace experience.

First, study the documented history of problems, their solutions, facilities, technology, and \\nthe resulting knowledge (theory, knowledge, guidelines) to understand the physics of the problem and \\nthe solution approach. Second, tailor the results to the individual project under consideration. A natural \\noutcome of this tailoring is the further development and enhancement of models, simulations, test \\nfacilities, etc., that are keys to good design and are the basis for solving the complex problems that \\ndevelop during the new product's design and operation. The importance of having this knowledge, these \\ntools, and facilities going into a new product cannot be overstated.

Why Study Problems \\nThe study of problems and their solutions is the foundation of the success of future space programs. \\nThe design and operation of these space programs are very complex and challenging, pushing the state of the art. They are made up of space vehicles, spacecraft, payloads, manufacturing facilities, and operations facilities (including communication systems) that continuously push state-of-the-art technol ogy in engineering, management, and leadership. The systems being developed are highly tuned, balanced between competing requirements. This is true whether one is designing a turbopump, balanc ing the hydro output (pressure, flow) with vibration, stability, life, weight, and cost, or a launch vehicle\\'s performance versus operational robustness, cost, schedule, etc. In general, these systems are high- performance driven, which leads to a \"high-q\" system (sensitive to small changes and highly tuned).'}],\n",

An excellent discussion of product time phasing by Utterback is in \"The Dynamics of Innovation\" in reference 5. There are two major observations in the book. The first has to do with shift ing of emphasis from the product development (technology) to the process (fig 1). The second deals with the impacts of the invading radical, innovative technologies on the established products (fig. 2). Invading technologies cause the established product to accomplish bursts of improvement to counteract the invasion. For a period of time, this works; however, if the invading technologies are strong, they can win out and replace the product.

Now whenever a change is made by the passage of energy and a result is left, this event \\ntakes place in a group of things. Things are always together.

When you put energy into a system you can never choose what kind of changes \\nshall take place and what kind of results shall remain...

This you do by design.\" He talks about the compromises in \\nthe design for failures. \"The requirements for design conflict and cannot be reconciled. All designs for \\ndevices are in some degree failures... The designer or his client has to choose to what degree and where these shall be failures .... \" Pugh, in \"Total Design, \\'\\'9 discusses in detail how the design problem is approached.

During the time of the V-2 (World War II in Germany) and Redstone (figs. 12a and 12b) \\n(after World War II in the United States), the control technology could neither cope with aerodynamically \\nunstable vehicles, nor with aerodynamically unstable control surfaces. The vehicle had to be stabilized \\nwith fins of sufficient size to keep the center of pressure behind the center of gravity at all times, \\nand the center of pressure of control surfaces had to be downstream of the hinge line. Primary control \\nwas exerted by jet vanes (aerodynamic controls require dynamic pressure to be effective, and are thus \\nuseless near lift-off and cut-off). Jet vane size had to be minimized to reduce the thrust loss from their \\ndrag. In addition, jet vanes are close to the single-engine-vehicle\\'s longitudinal axis and provide only \\nweak roll control. The effect of side winds on the fins creates \"rolling-moments-due-to-combined-pitchand-\\nyaw\" proportional to the dynamic pressure. The jet vanes could not overcome these moments. \\nTherefore, aerodynamic control vanes were added at the fin tips of both missiles. These vanes were coupled \\nwith the jet vanes, and were driven by the same actuators. The Redstone had about the same range \\nand payload weight as the V-2. However, the payload was a nuclear bomb, and the circular probable \\nimpact error was reduced to 450 m through terminal guidance of the separated entry body, i.e., the \\nbiconical nose of the missile. The circular probable error of the V-2 was about 10 times as large. The \\nterminal guidance required: (1) Attitude control during the exoatmospheric flight of the separated warhead, to keep the control \\ngyros from hitting their stops and losing their alignment. This control was accomplished \\nwith cold gas control jets located at the roots of the warhead air vanes. The jet controls were \\nhard-coupled with the air vanes. \\n(2) An aerodynamic design of the warhead and its air vanes for minimum center of pressure shift \\nwith Mach number, in order to minimize control system size and weight. This had to be \\naccomplished on paper, and methods for this had to be developed along the way, since supersonic \\nwind tunnels were not operational during the initial years of the Redstone design.

Sloshing propellant coupled through the \\ncontrol system and became unstable. This instability saturated the control system, and the vehicle went \\nout of control during the maximum dynamic pressure regime of launch and broke up. The results were \\ndynamic, with beautiful fireworks high in the sky, but very costly to the program. The instability was \\naggravated by the trajectory tilt program. The tilt program was a series of discrete steps instead of a \\ncontinuous functional change that started the oscillation and reinforced the amplitudes of the wave \\nthrough a forced oscillation. At this early phase in the rockets and space age, models did not exist for \\nanalyzing problems of this type. As a result, several things happened. Propellant sloshing data had to be \\nobtained quickly. No analytical solutions were readily available. A test program was started that \\nincluded both scale-model and full-scale testing. A slosh suppresser had to be found before the next \\nlaunch. In order to meet this goal, a full-size propellant tank filled with water was placed on a railroad \\ncar. The railroad car was bumped against the track end stop as an excitation source. The first test was \\nwithout suppression devices. Water was used to simulate propellant to establish frequencies, etc. Various \\ndevices were tried next as suppressers. The one chosen was called beer cans, which consisted of \\nlong perforated cylinders with flotation spheres at the top. The entire surface of the propellant was \\ncovered with these devices (fig. 17). The test showed more than adequate suppression was achieved, and \\nthe next launch was slosh free. In the meantime, other solutions were pursued, including development of \\nanalytical characterization of the sloshing propellant. This resulted in the development of slosh baffles \\n(rings inside the tank that became part of the structural stiffness (fig. 18)), as the most effective \\nanalytical means of suppressing slosh, and parametric test data were acquired for oscillating propellants \\nin both zero-and high-gravity (g) fields. Today, all space vehicles are analyzed and designed with this \\nphenomenon in focus as a potential problem. The lack of analytical and experimental data prior to \\nlaunching, as well as lack of experience in these type problems, led to the failure of the Jupiter missile \\ndue to propellant sloshing control system coupling. The fix was fairly easy and did not impact flight \\nschedules drastically. This is not always the case, and repeats of this type instability should be avoided if \\npossible.

The IUS was an upper stage vehicle under Air Force management that NASA \\nbought for several of its missions, including the launching of the tracking data relay satellites (TDRS). It \\nconsisted of a solid propulsion stage and an inertial unit for guidance and control. For planetary \\nmissions, it was modified by adding an additional stage named payload assist module (PAM-S), built by \\nMcDonnell Douglas. The IUS was designed and built by Boeing. Figure 30 shows the basic IUS \\nconfiguration as used by NASA for its different missions. It weighed 32,000 lb and was designed to fit \\ninto the shuttle cargo bay with the payload attached to the IUS nose. The configuration with the PAM-S \\nattached with its payload is shown on figure 31. One additional part of the design had to do with the \\nsupport cradle that had to raise the IUS perpendicular to the shuttle payload bay, then eject out of the \\nbay. The first stage was not ignited until the orbiter had moved a safe distance from the IUS system. \\nThis cradle, with the IUS attached in the orbiter bay, had to have a special design to move the resulting \\nscissors mode away from the shuttle lift-off dynamic modes, or pay a huge weight penalty. For safety \\nreasons the expulsion system was energized by springs instead of pyros. Figure 32 shows the cradle \\ndesign. \\n2. Creativity/Innovations. Several innovative design features were incorporated in the IUS \\ndesign (fig. 33). It used an extruding nozzle extension in order to conserve space in the transportation \\nmode. Pyro initiated time instead of electronics was used for timing of separation, etc., as was also done \\non the PAM. The design of the cradle and separation system was unique and of a safe weight, and it was \\nsafe for manned flight. The simplicity made for a robust system. \\n3. Problems. The main problem that occurred with IUS was early in the program when it was \\nbeing launched from Air Force missiles for their payloads. The extruding nozzle extension failed, \\ncausing a loss of mission. Teams of Air Force, NASA, and industry were formed to evaluate the \\nproblem and come up with a fix. This was accomplished and no further problems have occurred other \\nthan the normal changing out of parts as they aged on the shelf between uses. \\nSpacecraft \\nInterface \\nPlane \\nEquipment Support Section Solid Rocket Motor • Length: 17 ft \\nInterstage Structure • Weight: 32,500 Ib \\nSolid Rocket \\n• 3-Axis Stabilized Motor \\nFigure 30.

As this need became more and more apparent, various integration \\napproaches were tried. The integration working group approach was chosen. In terms of the launch \\nvehicle and the propulsion system, this was a group consisting of all the NASA centers' interacting disciplines, \\nleads, elements, chief engineers, and contractor equivalents. The groups working the launch \\nvehicle were named the ascent flight system integration group and the propulsion system integration \\ngroup.

A list of the shuttle flight data and an in-flight anomaly list is \\npublished by JSC in JSC-19413 and is revised periodically. A similar report is published at MSFC in \\nMSFC-1600 Rev C.

The \\nproblem was a resonating edge tone of the valve/sleeve housing gap as the high speed lox flowed across \\n_t, exciting the sleeve and causing the seal to rub and catch on fire. In order to find where the excitation \\nwas coming from, a buzzing valve was put in the lox cold flow facility at MSFC and tested to duplicate \\nthe vibration experienced on the engine. Once the buzz was established, wax was put in the various \\ncavities, one at a time to determine which was the excitation source. When the sleeve/housing gap was \\nfilled, the vibration stopped. The solution was to tailor a washer to fill the cavity. No vibration has occurred in the MOV since 1980.'}],\n",

The \\ncreative use of damping seals, an invention of George von Pragenau, basically solved the whirl problems \\nand reduced the forced vibration levels. Extrapolating from the damping seal concept, Von Pragenau, in \\nconjunction with Rocketdyne, developed and demonstrated a hydrodynamic damping seal bearing that \\nnot only provided adequate damping but also was the rotor support bearing. This damping seal bearing \\nconcept was demonstrated for the SSME lox pump in the MSFC engine testbed. A total of five hot engine firings was used to demonstrate this approach. The bearing lifted off early in the start sequence, \\neliminating the concern of rub in gaseous oxygen (gox) during startup and shutdown. An innovative \\ntechnique for balancing the spinning parts had to be devised because it was generally not possible to \\nbalance the parts assembled into a pump.

       "   'answer': 'Many other innovations were apparent as various problems occurred. The numerous major hot- fire development problems were studied and resolved using Government/contractor concurrent engineering teams, usually called failure investigation boards. Although the word \"concurrent engineering\" was not in vogue, the operating approach and team makeup were part of the characteristics of the \"current\" definition. (See reference 20 for a discussion of the approach.) The teams, in general, used fault trees or FMEA\\'s in a formal way to resolve very complex technically induced hardware fail ures. The use of these failure boards or teams was very effective and innovative. The use of concurrent engineering or ad hoc teams (tiger teams) has evolved to deal with complex technical issues such as fatigue problems, weld problems, and special problems such as 4,000 Hz, turbine blade cracking, bear ing wear, and manufacturing issues. Major technology breakthroughs have occurred in the development of special materials and materials processing, such as the development and use of silicon nitrite ball bearings to solve the turbomachinery bearing wear issues, 65 and single-crystal _turbine blades to solve blade cracking issues. The development of CFD analysis techniques to predict the internal fluid and gas flow environment was also a major accomplishment. Parallel to this was the development of special air- and water-flow facilities to benchmark these CFD models. Detailed finite element dynamic and stress modeling reached its pinnacle for meeting accuracy requirements and performance in order to under stand and solve the many fatigue issues. The extreme thermal environments and thermal gradients required the same level of sophistication. Materials characterization had to reach new levels due to the use of exotic materials, and the extreme environments created very small critical flaw sizes that drove many innovative, as well as more accurate, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) approaches. X ray, dye penetrant, ultrasonic, etc., were a part of these NDE advances. Internal instrumentation was developed to measure and quantify environments. Large advances were made in hot-fire data acquisition, data evaluation, and data banking; and electronic data transfer became standard practice. The engine system performance data and the high-frequency turbomachinery (vibration data) are good examples. The approach collects and evaluates vibration data from 0 to 4,000 Hz. Spectrums, ISO plots, RMS plots, mean and variances, etc., are produced and data banked. The historical data banks of physical data formulated in a probabilistic and reliability sense are used to manage hardware maintenance and to ensure flight safety. Data exist now for over 2,000 ground tests and 80 shuttle flights (three engines each flight). As a result of this large data base, decisions are made for flight based on expected demonstrated levels and hardware successes. In general, a piece of SSME hardware will not be flown with more accumulated time than one-half the ground demonstrated levels.'}],\n",

Many textbooks and technical \\npapers focus on the phenomenon; aircraft flutter garners the bigger emphasis. Internal flow in fluid \\nsystems experiences the same instabilities. An instability is generally defined as an increasing amplitude \\nstructural response where the fluid force is a function of the structural deflection causing the problem. \\nThe SSME lox system fits the characteristics required to produce instabilities, high density-large \\nflow velocities, thus, a very high dynamic pressure. Many problems have occurred in this system. The \\ninlet tee to the lox dome of the main combustion chamber (fig. 56) is a classic example of what can \\nhappen. The tee has a two-blade splitter (flow between, and on each side of, the two vanes) designed to \\nmore evenly distribute the lox flow to the powerhead. On most engines (90 percent) nothing happened. \\nHowever, on 10 percent of the engines, a high-frequency, high-amplitude (4,000 Hz, 100 g's) oscillation \\noccurred. If run long enough, the vanes crack, detuning the structure from the flow, eliminating or \\ngreatly reducing the response. Two types of structural elastic flow interaction are possible: (1) vortex \\nshedding, and (2) flutter-type instability. Extensive effort was expanded to understand the problem \\nthrough a team effort by MSFC and Rocketdyne for approximately 3 years.

       "   'answer': \"?9 There are two generic sources of bearing wear: (1) heat generation and (2) heat dissipation. \\nThere is always heat generation. The concern is excessive heat generation. Not enough heat dissipation \\nwill allow even a nominal heat generation bearing to overheat. Thus, the fault tree, or failure tree, had to \\nlist all the potential causes under each from lubrication, materials, to coolant. To illustrate how fault tree \\nanalysis can lead down blind paths until the data are collected and understood, the pump that ran the \\nlongest period of time had a different prelubrication treatment and still had lubrication present when the \\npump was disassembled. As a result, lubrication experts were called in and many tests were conducted \\non lubricant application before it was ruled out as a cause. A second blind alley occurred because the \\nbearing rig test had demonstrated long life. These tests did not have the damper seal and had parallel \\nbearing support with good bearing loads. It was thought that the damper seal caused the bearing to \\nunload or that the bearing was tilting due to lack of load. The damper seal acted as a rotor support. Two \\npumps were built, one with no damper seal by the bearing and the other with a small clearance and an \\neccentric load. Both bearings wore quickly. By then, time was running out so the advanced-technology \\nsilicon nitride balls were installed in a pump. This pump ran many tests'without ball wear. The team was \\nsimultaneously working on heat dissipation and, therefore, also added jet cooling (lox) to the bearings at \\nthe contact point and outer-race-guided cages.

As discussed previously, the pump-end damper seal supports the shaft for a certain range of \\nforces before the pump-end ball bearing stiffness becomes effective. Until then, the pump mode (one of \\nthe rotor criticals) is near the pump operating speed. This would make the pump sensitive to force perturbations \\nuntil the ball bearing clearance is reduced to zero. The second thrust has to do with the roller \\nbearing and its support structure on the turbine end. Hot-fire data have clearly shown that the hot gas is \\ncausing the structure to snap. Figure 68 shows the temperature rise in the cavity, indicating a structural \\nshift. Also, impedance of the roller bearing hardware indicates that the roller bearing is slipping.

The HPM is shown in figure 80. It is 146 inches in diameter, 1,500-inches (125-feet) long, and \\nhas a dry weight of 149,000 lb. Fully loaded, it weighs 1,260,000 lb and has a maximum thrust of \\n3,600,000 lb, with a maximum internal pressure of 980 lb/in 2. It is composed of 11 steel segments, \\nincluding forward and aft domes. The segments are joined using tang and clevis factory joints at the \\nfactory in Utah to form four approximately equal-length segments. The four casting segments are \\nshipped by rail to the launch site. The motor is assembled at the launch site using the field joints and is \\nthen assembled with the SRB parts, then with the other shuttle elements. The SRB parts include at least \\nthe aft skirt, the forward skirt, the recovery parachutes, control gyros, SRB-to-ET attach struts, and \\nseparation motors. The total system is shown in figure 80 and the combined dry weight of the SRM and \\nSRB is 193,000 lb. \\nThe RSRM was essentially the same as the HPM, but had features added that solved the problems \\nthat led to the STS-51L failure. The thrust profile (same as the HPM's thrust profile) is tailored to \\nmaintain maximum dynamic pressure constraints and maximum acceleration during the latter part of the \\nburn time. The first redesign change was in the field joint configuration, which went from a single clevis \\nto a double clevis and an additional O-ring (fig. 81). It also had J-flaps designed in the insulation for the \\nfield joint that provided additional joint sealing. This J-flap was made by extending the propellant-tomotor \\ninsulation and changing the end configuration (fig. 82). Other improvements were made during \\nthe down time such as the nozzle configuration, and the ignitor.\"}],\n",

       "   'answer': \"b. Evoloti0n/Creativity/Innovation. Designing the SRB/SRM to maximum/minimum loads \\ninstead of time-consistent loads was an approach that saved redesigns and cost as the shuttle system \\nevolved and loads increased. This approach early in the program was optimal since the dry weight of the \\nSRM/SRB to payload to orbit was approximately 8 to 1. This meant that approximately 8 lb of structural \\nweight would only penalize the performance 1 lb. Late in the development program as loads increased, \\ntime consistent loads could be used to reduce stresses, thus no redesign or weight increases were \\nrequired as the loads increased. \\nIn the process of reducing operational costs, it was decided to recover the SRB's. Recovering these elements meant that several technologies had to be expanded and applied to this mission phase. \\nReentry aerodynamic heating drove many aspects of the thermal protection system (TPS). Special testing \\ntechniques were required to quantify the induced environments and verify the TPS. Reentry aerodynamics \\nwere in the same category due to the large and fast-changing angle of attack. Reentry acoustics, \\ndue to the tail-first reentry and the long cavity coupled with the large varying angle of attack, were \\nin the same category. Water impact on the booster was a major technological challenge due to both the speed and angles of impact. Additionally, the water entry angle created air pockets around the motor that \\ncollapse with large forces. Understanding and characterizing the sea state was a fundamental part of the \\nwater impact loads. Various type drop-test programs were created, including the need for pressure \\nscaling to handle the cavity collapse. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL) pressure facility was used \\nfor this. The system problem of dealing with various initial conditions, from SRB separation (shuttle \\ntrajectory variations, separation motor variations, etc.) coupled with the SRB mass properties variation, \\nthe atmosphere characteristics, and the parachute system, led to the Monte Carlo techniques to define the \\nconditions for parachute deployment, acoustic and thermal. A technique (innovation) was developed for \\naccomplishing the reentry aero acoustics testing in a continuous-flow wind tunnel where the angle of \\nattack could be varied (swept) real-time. Spectral analysis was accomplished, dictating the angles of \\nattack where the acoustics were tuned and amplified.

A very interesting problem occurred on STS-4. The \\nparachute G-switch activated early on both SRB\\'s, releasing the chute from each SRB, resulting in a loss \\nof both the SRB\\'s. The G-switch was installed to release one of the two parachute risers at water impact, \\nenchancing SRB recovery. In this case, the switches were activated during the time of frustum severance \\nbefore chute deployment during the atmospheric reentry phase. The severance is accomplished using a \\nlinear-shaped charge. Figure 95 shows the frustum chute package and linear-shaped charge. The \\nG-switch was mounted to the SRB skirt after the linear-shaped charge on the leA firewall, which was \\nmounted on the forward skirt reaction ring (fig. 96). The problem occurred in this manner. The linear-\\nshaped charge caused a shock wave in the SRB skirt, which excited the reaction ring in its first cantilever \\nmode of 85 Hz. This drove the IEA, hence the G-switch. The G-switch natural frequency was near \\n70 Hz and should have been critically damped. The G-switch response triggered the chute attach bolt, \\nhence the loss of the chute performance and the SRB\\' s. The first three shuttle flights (six SRB\\' s) had no \\nproblem; however, STS-4 had the same problem on each SRB. Why the difference? It turned out after much testing (pyro and G-switch response) that all flights were near a problem. These two SRB\\'s exceeded limits because of two factors relating to G-switch damping. The temperature decreased the \\ndamping, and the switches were fabricated on the low damping side, but not outside the specifications. \\nThis, combined with the expected variation in pyro shock response, led to the problem. No one thought \\nthat the G-switch of such a low frequency would respond to the shock, based on the qualification test \\nrun without the resonant mode of the support ring, hence the problem was missed. Many months of investigation time were required to find the culprit, although all pieces of data existed prior to the \\nfailures. The problem was putting the pieces together in the proper manner.

Many innovative processes, as well as design concepts, had to be \\ndeveloped in order to meet the stringent performance goals without compromising safety since the space \\nshuttle is a manned vehicle. The first of these was the fracture control plan and its implementation, \\nwhich is required to ensure that no failure (tank rupture) would occur during flight. There are several \\naspects to this plan. (1) NDE techniques had to be verified for this application and expressed as a typical \\nprobability of detection (POD). The welds are dye-penetration inspected and x-rayed. (2) Each tank is \\nproof-tested at ambient, which not only screens for critical flaws in the structure, guaranteeing a flight \\nwithout failure with a life factor of four, but also tests the structure to near ultimate when the cyro properties \\nare taken into account. (3) The tank is designed for leak-before-burst for nearly all welds. Where it \\nis not, or where it is not properly proofed, the rewelds are x-rayed again. (4) Substantial analog testing \\nof each skin thickness with welds, where a flaw is grown by fatigue to critical flaw size, then is tested \\nthrough mission profiles until failure. At least a factor of four must be obtained for the lowest of the \\nfamily tested. (5) A Government and contractor fracture control board, composed of stress, fatigue, \\nmaterials, and NDE experts, reviews each reported flaw for flight safety. (6) All flaws found during \\nmanufacturing (x ray and dye penetration) are repaired before final assembly and proof testing. \\nProbably the most innovative design feature of the LWT was the reduction of the standard safety factor from 1.4 to as low as 1.25. The reduced factor was based on the degree of knowledge of the loads, \\ni.e., longitudinal acceleration and internal pressure loads. If the load included all these loads, then a \\nfactor of 1.25 was used. If the load was mixed with 90 percent well known and the other 10 percent not \\nwell known, then a factor of 1.29 would be used.

The cause, when understood, was quite benign and would cause no problem. Prior to \\nfilling the tanks with cryo fuel, the overall tank is several inches longer than it is when loaded with cryo \\nand it shrinks due to'the lower temperature. In orderto compensate for this shrinkage, the SRB struts are \\ncanted 7 ° so that when the tank cyro shrinks, the struts are perpendicular to each element.

Early in the program, the struts were pretensioned \\nto reduce and balance this load. Later, the tank was designed to handle the load. The thermal \\ndeformations are stored in the structure as potential energy, which is released as a part of the lift-off \\ndynamics. \\n(3) To save cost and handling, it was decided to replace the tank nose cone made of A1 with a \\ncomposite nose cone. Two problems occurred with this design. The first was caused by a lack of understanding \\nof the coefficient of expansion difference between the composite and the A1 to which it was to \\nbe mated. The loads introduced would fail the nose cone when propellant was loaded. The second had to \\ndo with mating the holes with the top of the lox tank.

Buckling is a very difficult problem to analyze since small eccentricities \\ngreatly magnify the instability in a nonlinear manner. The ET development, although keenly aware of \\nthe buckling potential, had a buckling occur during testing. This was due to the tank having to trim as \\nmuch weight as possible to gain shuttle performance (1 lb of tank equals approximately 1 lb of payload \\nto orbit). The first occurred during the mated ground vibration test program (MGVT). It occurred while \\ndraining the lox tank (water) in order to simulate a flight condition (fig. 105). Operational procedures \\nhave been changed so that this buckling is never experienced on the pad during launch operations. \\nFigure 106 is a sketch of the buckled area. \\n(6) Two major problems have occurred on the SLWT during development: welding and weld \\nrepairs, and achieving the fracture toughness desired for fracture mechanics safety. Special techniques \\nhave had to be implemented for the welding and weld repair processes that include not only speed and \\nproper forms and clamping, but also the use of backside purging, weld sequencing, and weld planishing \\nto reduce residual stresses. Planishing can, however, be a problem in that it can also cause the weld to \\ncrack.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the world\\'s largest and greatest orbiting \\noptical telescope. 68 Its accuracy and precision are unprecedented. Even with the problem of aberration \\nof the mirror, which has been partially corrected, its contribution to science and our understanding of the \\nuniverse has grown by leaps and bounds. The pointing accuracy of 0.007 arc s, which is equivalent to \\nfocusing on a dime from Washington, DC, to Boston, is unequaled in the optics world. The HST (fig. \\n110) is composed of the outer protective shell (called the SSM), the momentum wheels that control the \\nvehicle by varying each wheel\\'s speed, and the aperture door for blocking direct sunlight from the \\ninstruments, allowing more science time. The inner parts are the heart of the optical telescope assembly \\n(OTA) system composed of the metering truss mounting, the primary and secondary mirrors, the focal \\nplane structure, and the aft truss mounting the scientific instruments. Figure 111 shows an exploded \\nview of the OTA with the scientific instruments. To eliminate thermal distortion in one direction, the \\nOTA frames are built of composites that have near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the \\nlongitudinal direction. The mirrors must be accurately located relative to each other driving this CTE \\nrequirement. The light enters striking the primary mirror, which focuses it on the secondary mirror. The \\nsecondary mirror focuses the light back through a hole in the center of the primary mirror onto the scientific instruments. The instruments are: (1) the fine guidance sensor, (2) the faint object spectrograph, \\n(3) the wide field planetary camera, (4) the photometer, (5) the high-resolution spectrograph, and \\nVariOUS (6) the faint object camera. They function to perform the fine pointing and to gather \" scientific \\ndata for studying the universe (fig. 112). Power is provided by solar arrays in conjunction with storage \\nbatteries. The control system uses six rate gyros and two fine guidance optical sensors to provide roll, \\npitch, and yaw information, and is designed to the observatory, accurately locked to within the 0.007 \\narc s on a subject for extended periods. This is equivalent to a 1.22-cm offset at a distance of 600 mi \\n(1,000 km). Temperatures within the telescope are controlled actively and passively to assure pointing \\naccuracy and structural stability. The system was designed for maintenance and refurbishment on-orbit \\nat approximately 5-year intervals.

       "   'answer': \"b. Evolution/Creativity/Innovation. The basic idea of a tethered system itself is very innovative, \\nespecially in light of potential applications mentioned earlier, and others not mentioned. The basic \\nphysics of the problem of using tethered systems centers around the conservation of momentum of the \\norbit. In this case, the orbiter and the satellite are a system in a specific orbit at a certain energy level, \\nwhich must be held constant. The tether keeps the two bodies, though separated, operating as one \\norbiting system with the energy level of the system before the tethered satellite was deployed. A \\ndeployment force (thrusters) moves the satellite out from where the two end masses were initially in the \\nsame orbit. The gravity gradient force is proportional to the separation distance. After a certain distance \\nfrom the orbiter, the combination of gravity gradient and centrifugal forces are sufficient to overcome \\nsystem losses (friction) and continue the separation. Because the two masses are constrained by the \\ntether, the upper mass gains a higher kinetic energy per unit mass than the lower mass. The tether \\nconstraint causes the orbiter and satellite to have the same angular velocity. During deployment, the \\nlower mass will drag the upper mass until libration occurs. This results in momentum transfer through \\nthe tether from the upper to lower mass as tension. The off-vehicle attitude is caused by the Coriolis \\nterm of the acceleration expression creating libration of the system as the tether length is changed (fig. \\n143). The Coriolis force is perpendicular to the Earth's radius for radial deployment/retrieval. \\n153 Figure 136. TSS-1.\"}],\n",

As discussed above, the orbiter-tether-satellite system interacts dynamically and \\nwith the environment, setting up several modes of dynamic oscillation. These modes are shown as if the \\norbiter was fixed, which is a fair assumption due to the relative differences in mass of the orbiter and \\nsatellite (fig. 145). The libration mode can be damped by changing the tether tension with the correct \\nphasing with the motion. The pendulous mode can be damped with the satellite attitude control, if \\nneeded. The major problem is the tether string mode governed by the tether length and tension. This \\nmode can be set up by the aerodynamic or electromagnetic forces, the greatest being the electromagnetic. \\nAs the tether is pulled in during deployment, due to energy conservation and the tether length \\nchanges, the amplitude and frequency increase. As the length shortens to around 600 m, the string mode \\nand the satellite spin mode get in resonance, causing large satellite angular excursions. The results are \\neither the inability to dock the satellite due to the misalignment or the loss of tether tension, hence, \\ncontrol.

The elements of this approach were: (1) observing the skiprope amplitude and phase using \\nsatellite information (rate gyro telemetry data) as discussed above, (2) orbiter yaw maneuver during the \\nsecond period of science at the 2.4-km distance based on the observed data to reduce the skiprope \\namplitude below 20 m (the amplitude that could be handled during reel in from 2.4 km), (3) attitude control of the satellite during the resonance period discussed above, and (4) use of a passive \\ntether damper to suppress the skiprope as the satellite gets close to the orbiter. \\nThe passive damper was an innovation within itself. Figure 146 shows the damper installed in \\nthe docking ring. It consists of a yoke and ring through which the tether is passed from the reel below \\nand three small negator motors located 120 ° apart on the docking ring attached with cables to the \\nyoke/ring; thus, as the tether moves, the yoke/ring moves the cables and the negator motors provide \\ndamping to the skiprope.

Through the use of concurrent \\nengineering teams composed of a cadre of all the potential specialists involved, \\nincluding manufacturing and processing, and using a formal fault tree approach (fishbone \\nworks just as well),.the probe causes and solution can efficiently be found. All organizations \\nshould be trained early in both teaming and fault tree analysis. \\n23. Regardless of the technical adequacy/integrity of the answer, it always has to be sold politically; \\ntherefore, it must become part of the design culture either by changing the culture or \\nthe recommendation. In other words, the proposal must always be politically viable. \\nEngineers, therefore, must also be salesmen. \\n24. Quality must be built in, not inspected in.

Understanding and using statistics/probabilities approaches are fundamental for conducting \\nstudies, evaluating data, manufacturing hardware, understanding and quantifying sensitivities, \\nand performing operations. \\n26. Maintaining electronic data bases of analysis, tests, and flights are necessary and should be \\nplanned for. Electronic transfer of data and networking is necessary in today\\'s multilocation \\nworkforce. Communication is aided greatly by these approaches. \\n27. Design of experiments is an effective tool for both analysis and test planning and should be \\nin each engineer\\'s tool kit. \\nIt would not be appropriate to conclude this report without making some statement as to the \\nfuture challenges that face space exploration and what some of the present technology focus implies. \\nThe biggest challenge facing space exploration is, \"How do you effectively consider cost along with performance \\nand reliability as design metrics?\" The biggest problem is obtaining the cost metrics so that \\nappropriate trades can be made and a true optimum system designed. This is complicated by the fact that \\npart of the cost metrics indicates higher performance and fewer launch stages, which greatly complicates \\nthe equation since higher performance indicates greater sensitivities to uncertainties that include, but are \\nnot limited to, manufacturing, environments, operations, and evolving requirements. For example, a \\nsingle-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle must balance three different efficiencies to narrow margins \\nif it is to meet both performance and cost goals. To a large extent, meeting these is a paradox in that to \\nget one will result in a costly change in another. The three keys are: (1) a highly efficient propulsion \\nsystem that not only includes Isp, but includes thrust and thrust-to-weight; (2) structural or dry mass \\nefficiency (this is not only the basic structure, but includes TPS, components, avionics, etc.); and (3) to \\nmanage the losses (managing the margins) that includes technology readiness degradations, \\nenvironments surprises, etc. Past launch vehicles had many impacts due to not properly managing the \\nlosses, resulting in load increases, inefficient trajectories, etc. Managing the losses effectively is a major \\nchallenge. This means that sensitivities must be well understood, traded, and managed. For example, \\nhigh acceleration during the near-Earth phase of flight is efficient for managing gravity losses, but \\ncreates unacceptable loads for the structure and for the humans. True optimum trajectories create large \\naerodynamic loads, which are not acceptable. Load relief control reduces these loads, but introduces \\npath deviations, thus performance loses. Then when the vehicle moves back toward the optimum after \\nleaving the high-density part of the atmosphere, large angles of attack are introduced, increasing thermal \\nenvironments. Leaving the Earth\\'s atmosphere, Isp is important for propulsion system efficiency. \\nClearly then, understanding environments, sensitivities, and trades from a system viewpoint is \\nmandatory in order to meet the challenges of the future. The same types of things are true for satellites, \\nupper stages, etc.; however, the tent poles vary and are considered different parameters.'}],\n",

These lessons have been both general in nature as well as very specific technically. The \\nfirst major lesson is \"high-performance requirements drive sensitivities, thus for reusable systems, \\nproblems in fatigue and fracture. Fatigue and fracture then must be a major part of the design and operation \\nof these high-performance systems. Welds in these systems should be designed to have lower stress \\nthan the parent material, reducing fracture and fatigue concerns. Welds should be eliminated where \\npossible. Stress concentrations should be reduced or eliminated. The design should accommodate NDE \\nas well as repairs. This is particularly true for welds.

Design development hardware for \\ninstrumentation so that environments and dynamics, etc., can be verified. High energy concentrations \\nsuch as turbomachinery are very susceptible to instability problems such as whirl and must have design \\naugmentation to control potential problems. Dynamic tuning between structure, flow, and acoustics is a \\nmajor source of problems not only in turbomachinery, but also in all high q flow areas and combustion \\ndevices.

For example on July \\n1, 1987, test 902-428 of engine 2106 experienced a premature cut-off after 204.12 s of a 700-s test. The \\ntest ended when the high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) discharge temperature dropped below the \\ndisqualification limit. Inspection revealed moderate erosion of the oxidizer preburner (OPB) faceplate \\nand a burn through of the high pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) inlet housing. Leak checking of the OPB found a large leak due to braze cracking around a baffle. Metallurgical inspection of the crack \\nsurface showed 10 arrest lines that seemed to match with the 10 proof cycles seen by the hardware. \\nReview of the test history found that this unit had experienced three large lox dome detonations (or \\nPOP's) exceeding 8,580 g's peak-to-peak, with the last one happening on test 902-427. Based upon \\nthese observations, it was determined that a poor quality braze joint was work hardened by proof cycles. \\nThe POP during test 902-427 then loaded the braze joint to failure.

The lox posts that carry lox to the combustion chamber are typical of a class of problems that \\noccur (figs. A-6, A-7, and A-8). Two incidents of fuel preburner lox post failures have occurred in the \\nhistory of the SSME test program. Failure investigation of engines 0009 and 0204 found that the damage to the FPB was caused by similar failure mechanisms. Metallurgical examination of the lox posts from \\nboth of these engines discovered high cycle fatigue (HCF) cracks located at the braze fillet radius \\nregions. Also, all engine 0009 lox posts exhibited cold worked material (austenitic to martensitic \\ntransformation) at the fracture location. Analysis and tests confirmed high main stage mechanical \\nvibration and dynamic flow loads. Based on this, it was determined that the through cracks probably \\ndeveloped at the fillet radius during main stage, thus mixing lox and fuel. However, it was noted that \\nalthough mechanical vibration was the main load source, it was insufficient to cause the damage. \\nProbably, offset fuel sleeve holes caused an additional flow-induced alternating stress. This, when \\ncombined with the mechanical vibration stress, exceeded the material endurance strength.'}],\n",

Metallurgical data determined that an \\neddy current reading of 5 V or more is sufficient to aggravate the fatigue failure. A method to reduce the \\nfatigue load on the lox posts where eddy current exceeded or met a 5-V value was developed. This \\ntechnique requires the placement of three support pins, equally spaced between the inner and outer \\nsleeve annulus, thus. reducing the cantilever length and dynamic loads. All current flight preburner lox \\nposts are inspected at a predetermined interval and pins are installed if required.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) \\nThe positive aspect of problem occurrences is the opportunity for learning and a challenge for innovation. The learning aspect is not restricted to the solution period of the problem occurrence, but can become the beacon for problem prevention on future programs. Problems/failures serve as a point of departure for scaling to new designs. To ensure that problems/failures and their solutions guide the future programs, a concerted effort has been expended to study these problems, their solutions, their derived lessons learned, and projections for future programs. This includes identification of technology thrusts, process changes, codes development, etc. However, they must not become an excuse for adding layers upon layers of standards, criteria, and requirements, but must serve as guidelines that assist instead of stifling engineers. This report is an extension of prior efforts to accomplish this task. Although these efforts only scratch the surface, it is a beginning that others must complete.'}],\n",

However, Earth's gravitational sphere of influence is not infinite, so it is possible to go slower than that and still escape the sphere of influence (Because of the sun.) If a rocket starts accelerating from 0 on Earth's surface, what speed would it have to be going at, say, 100 km above the Earth's surface for it to escape Earth's gravity? How would you calculate this?\",\n",
       "  'answer': \"Earth's gravitational sphere of influence is not infinite \\n \\n That's your problem. The force of gravity does have an infinite range. There is no place in the universe where earth's gravity is not felt.  \\n As a result, it does not matter where you start, in order to escape earth, you need 11 km/s relative to the earth. If you first get into orbit at 100 km, then you already need a speed of 7 km/s for that. From that orbit, you only need an additional 4 km/s to escape earth altogether - but only because you are already going at 7 km/s. \\n EDIT \\n As pointed out by @uhoh the escape velocity does vary with altitude. However, the difference at 100 km is so small that I ignored it. Like the OP I approximated the escape velocity as 11 km/s. In actual fact, at ground level it is 11.186 km/s, and at 100 km it reduces to 11.099 km/s.   \\n The same approximation also ignores the fact that, if you are far enough from earth (924,000 km), the sun's gravity is stronger than earth's, and you leave the earth's Sphere of Influence - which is not an exact sphere. This is further complicated by the fact that it ignores the influence of the other planets and the moon. For example, when travelling to the moon, the gravitational field of the moon exceeds that of the earth (and the sun) when you're about 40,000 km from the moon.\",\n",

Throwing that into the  vis-viva  equation  $v^2 = GM\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{r} - \\\\frac{1}{a} \\\\right)$  where  $G$  is the gravitational constant,  $M$  the mass of earth,  $r$  the orbital  radius  (not altitude) at perigee and  $a$  the semimajor axis of the orbit gives a velocity at perigee of 11.05km/s. Using the escape velocity equation  $V_e = \\\\sqrt{2GM \\\\over r}$  you'd get an escape velocity at 100km altitude of 11.09km/s, so there's a  small  saving to be had but really, the edge of the sphere of influence is quite a long way away. \\n Whilst this isn't  quite  what you asked for, I'd be startled if your direct ascent trajectory involved a speed dramatically different from this figure.\",\n",

       " {'question': \"Selecting an optimal Isp / what makes an Isp too high (mostly for high Isp)\\nWhen, and why, is it possible to have an Isp (usually of an ion or nuclear engine with Isp far beyond the limits of chemical fuel) that's too high? What makes the Isp too high, and (other things being equal) why wouldn't you just want the maximum possible propellant efficiency so you can have plenty of delta-V without your vehicle being a flying fuel tank? \\n (This is assuming that it is fundamentally possible / affordable to be capable of a very high Isp. Obviously there is no point in the expense, hazard, and minimum size of a nuclear rocket when a cold gas thruster will easily achieve the needed delta-V. This is also not about the basic case of high-Isp thrusters often having too little thrust for planetary takeoff or other high-thrust needs.)\",\n",
       "  'answer': \"Optimal ISP depends on the dry mass scaling factors of the propulsion system, including its energy supply. \\n So, you know how the rocket equation requires exponentially more fuel for each incremental m/s of delta-v?  Adding that fuel requires a bigger fuel tank. The bigger fuel tank increases dry mass, which reduces the delta-v gained from all prior kilograms of fuel. Eventually, you hit a break even point where adding more fuel increases tank mass too much for that fuel to add any delta-v, and there is no more benefit from more fuel. \\n The above hopefully gives you some intuition, but doesn't directly answer the question (Don't worry, I'll do that below).  After all, adding fuel is not the same as adding ISP. And, indeed, for a chemical thruster, higher ISP is pretty much always better from a delta-v perspective - each kilo of fuel gives you more push, so the max delta-v point happens at a higher value (or, it would, if all else was equal, like fuel storage density, etc., which is not actually the case). The limits for chemical propulsion are really more related to reaction chemistry - no chemical reactions can provide exhaust velocities above a certain point (which is nowhere near the theoretical optimum for these systems). \\n On the other hand, in the case of electric thrusters (specifically FEEP or gridded ion thrusters) we have a clear theoretical understanding and engineering path to raise ISP basically as high as we want. We have linear accelerators, after all, which can accelerate ions to large fractions of light speed. We could strap one to a spacecraft, and just have at it. \\n But, just like chemical rockets, there are dry mass scaling factors that create an optimum max ISP. This is because of the way the equation for ion velocity after acceleration in an electric field (i.e. exhaust velocity for electric propulsion) works: v = sqrt(2 q V/m) where v = velocity, q = particle charge, V = accelerating voltage, and m = particle mass. Note that the velocity is proportional to the square root of the voltage; this means a linear increase in voltage (and thus in input power, for a given ion current) nets an exponentially less-than-linear increase in exhaust velocity or ISP. \\n Electric thrusters get their power from power supplies carried on board.  Getting more power to increase ISP requires bigger power supplies, which means add dry mass to the system.  Thus, the same logic applies as with bigger fuel tanks on chemical rockets - eventually, adding an incremental second of ISP requires adding an exponentially growing amount of dry mass that more than counteracts the benefit of more fuel efficiency, and you reach a maximum useful ISP. \\n The specific value of this maximum depends on the mass scaling rate (or specific power) of your power supply and thruster. For example, if my solar panels produce 20 W/kg, max useful ISP is much lower than if they produce 300 W/kg, because I can add a lot more energy to my fuel before I hit the breakeven point with added solar panel mass.  Nuclear reactors also mix this up because their mass scaling is non-linear; a 10 kW reactor weighs less than a 10 MW reactor, but not 1000x less, so economies of scale apply and the math gets complex.  But, as a general estimate, NASA doesn't really bother designing systems that exceed about 10,000 seconds of ISP, which tells you roughly where the limits are with current technology. \\n Two final notes: First, note that once an ion thruster reaches its max useful ISP, then the same logic applies as chemical thrusters for calculating its max possible delta-v; you add fuel until tank mass growth makes adding more fuel pointless, and that's as high as you can go with the tech you are using. At that point, the only ways to get more delta-v are to use specific orbital mechanics techniques like the Oberth effect and gravity assist maneuvers, or else rebuild the whole spacecraft to reduce dry mass and use parts with higher specific power (more watts per kilogram). \\n Second, max ISP is only really a major constraint for fairly exotic interplanetary mission planning.  In most cases what you actually want is to get to your destination quickly, not just to have as much delta-v as possible.  This makes thrust per watt (i.e. specific thrust) of the thruster just as relevant a metric as ISP, if not more so. And, if you return to the equation above, you will see that exhaust velocity is also proportional to the inverse of the square root of particle mass.  That means that heavier particles exit a thruster more slowly (lower ISP), but incremental mass decelerates them at an exponentially less-than-linear rate. Combine that with the linear relationship f = m a, the equation for power W = V A, and the fact that each particle is typically exactly 1 charge in the amperage calculation, and you quickly conclude that increasing particle mass linearly will linearly reduce ion amperage for a given mass flow rate; this causes a less-than-linear loss of ISP, but yields a linear increase in thrust per watt. \\n It's a tradeoff you basically always take unless you need an incredibly high delta-v for your mission, since it shaves dry mass in the form of power supply, or else shaves mission time by adding thrust for a given power supply. This is why we try to use heavy atoms as ion thruster fuel, like xenon or krypton - we would rather have more thrust than more ISP for many missions, and heavy particles offer the most bang for our wattage bucks.\",\n",
