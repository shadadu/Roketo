      "Since its founding, NASA has been dedicated to the advancement of aeronautics and space science. The NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Program Office plays a key part in helping NASA maintain this important role.\n",
      "The NASA STI Program Office is operated by Langley Research Center, the lead center for NASA’s scientific and technical information. The NASA STI Program Office provides access to the NASA STI Database, the largest collection of aeronautical and space science STI in the world. The Program Office is also NASA’s institutional mechanism for disseminating the results of its research and development activities. These results are published by NASA in the NASA STI Report Series, which includes the following report types:\n",
      "TECHNICAL PUBLICATION. Reports of completed research or a major significant phase of research that present the results of NASA programs and include extensive data or theoretical analysis. Includes compilations of significant scientific and technical data and information deemed to be of continuing reference value. NASA’s counterpart of peer-reviewed formal professional papers but has less stringent limitations on manuscript length and extent of graphic presentations.\n",
      "TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM. Scientific and technical findings that are preliminary or of specialized interest, e.g., quick release reports, working papers, and bibliographies that contain minimal annotation. Does not contain extensive analysis.\n",
      "CONTRACTOR REPORT. Scientific and technical findings by NASA-sponsored contractors and grantees.\n",
      "CONFERENCE PUBLICATION. Collected papers from scientific and technical conferences, symposia, seminars, or other meetings sponsored or cosponsored by NASA.\n",
      "SPECIAL PUBLICATION. Scientific, technical, or historical information from NASA programs, projects, and mission, often concerned with subjects having substantial public interest.\n",
      "This report is a compilation of Lessons Learned in approximately years of engineering experience by each, of James C. Blair, Robert S. Ryan and Luke Schutzenhofer. The lessons are the basis of a course on Lessons Learned that has been taught at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The lessons are drawn from NASA Space Projects and are characterized in terms of generic lessons learned from the project experience, which are further distilled into overarching principles that can be applied to future projects. \n",
      "Included are discussions of the overarching principles followed by a listing of the lessons associated with that principle. The Lesson with sub-lessons are stated along with a listing of the project problems the lesson is drawn from, then each problem is illustrated and discussed with conclusions drawn in terms of Lessons Learned. The purpose of this report is to provide principles learned from past aerospace experience to help achieve greater success in future programs, and Identify application of these principles to space systems design. The problems experienced provide insight into the engineering process and are examples of the subtleties one experiences performing engineering design, manufacturing and operations. A CD of a class taught on this subject is included, providing the illustrations used in this report, along with other related material. \n",
      "How to avoid the mistakes of the past and how to train people in the essence of engineering are mandatory questions we face in aerospace engineering. Those who forget the lessons from the past are doomed to repeat them. Dr. Wernher von Braun has said that; ―Crash programs fail because they are based on the theory that with nine women pregnant you can get a baby in a month.‖ Failure also occurs because we forget that physics rules and we try to bypass it in our designs. \n",
      "NASA and DOD have a great heritage in Space Systems programs that have been very successful; however, they are pushing the limits of technology in order to defeat gravity, survive extreme environments, and meet their programmatic goals. In pushing the limits, we have to take risks, and in taking risks we naturally have problems. \n",
      "The power density and the high efficiency requirements of space exploration lead to an unprecedented and challenging sensitivity of the system performance to the system parameters and their uncertainties, manufacturing practices, etc. which implies great risks and many potential problems. The experience we have had with these systems in the last six decades bears out these observations. NASA has lost astronauts three times, the first was the Apollo fire at KSC, the second was the loss of Challenger and its crew, and last the loss of Columbia and its crew. There are other failures that have led to loss of mission and many \n",
      "other problems that have had major program impacts. DOD and the commercial side of space exploration have experienced problems of the same general categories discussed. \n",
      "The goal of this report is to review the NASA programs, develop lessons learned, and from them derive basic principles that can be applied to future programs. While only those problems and systems worked on by the authors are included as examples, the lessons and principles are generic and can be applied in other technical and organizational arenas. The report concludes with a reiteration of the principles. \n",
      "NASA Programs \n",
      "We started out working with the Army Missile Command, on the Redstone and Jupiter missiles and their derivatives, which were eventually used in space exploration. The Saturn I was started as an Army project and then taken over by NASA. It was a vehicle that used current hardware and manufacturing processes in order to get an early heavy lift launch capability. The Saturn I first stage used the Jupiter manufacturing process and tank diameter for the center tank, and the Redstone tank diameter and manufacturing process for the clustered tanks. The first stage engines were H- ‘s produced by Rocketdyne, and the upper stage engines were RL- ‘s produced by Pratt & Whitney. After successfully launching the Saturn I vehicle we were transferred to the newly-formed NASA organization in and worked all the NASA programs including the potential new starts that did not materialize or were canceled before completion. Figure I- shows a partial list of the projects, and Figures I- , I- , I- & I- include pictures of some of the projects. Notice on Figure I- that a sketch of the Russian vehicles and the DOD vehicles are included. We had some small efforts on these systems.

We limited the projects and lessons to those that the authors had experience with. There are many other lessons in our collection which others have developed which are a rich source for the reader to explore. We next grouped the observations into generic and technical categories. We first subdivided the two categories into more definitive categories as shown on Figure IUnder these categories the observations were then grouped as lessons derived from the observations. Top level principles of design and management were distilled from these lessons. \n",

In fact, all infrastructures exist as an aid to the human personality and mind. Principle deals with how the challenge of putting systems in space drives everything, including all analysis and test and the project design. Principle deals with the system interactions and the fact that all the parts are interacting elements of the system. Communications is a key to understanding this systems aspect of a project or program. Principle is fundamental in that everything is governed by the laws of physics. In a broad sense this also includes the basic principles of finance, organization, etc. Principle deals with need for robustness and the understanding of sensitivities, uncertainties, risks and margins of the system.\n",

      "What is the basic lesson that we must reward all forms of creative actions of the people?\n",
      "The sub-topics of the general lesson that people are the prime resource state clearly that we cannot just depend on process and procedures to obtain a successful product; but, that the complexity of our space systems depends on the judgment and innovation of the people of the organization to create, build and manage a successful system. Dogma and rules, although they can guide and are necessary, can never replace this judgment and creativity of the human mind. In the end the human mind trumps. The same can be said of tools. We need process, procedures, criteria and guidelines but they should never be used to replace the creativity and the human judgment. We use these tools to aid in decision making but in the end most decisions are human judgments based on wisdom and understanding. One of the big questions design and operations of space systems raises continually is ―When is enough good enough for the system.‖ Our tendency is to be risk aversive and add detail way beyond what is good enough. Human judgment and creativity should be applied in all aspects of space operations. The organization should reward all expressions of creativity of its people and not have an organization governed by fear of failure. \n",
      "The complex technical and managerial problems we face depend on human judgment, creativity, and innovation for solutions. All our other tools are aids for the human mind in the performance of these tasks. Our job then is to bring out and develop these human resources. There are many examples that illustrate the value of human resources and how they have been rewarded. This creativity exists in many forms as illustrated next. The basic lesson is that we must reward all forms of creative actions of our people and start development of processes to remove inhibitors which suppress the creative actions of its people. \n",

[Holman, Special document] We have selected two of these to illustrate the content and value.  - deals with a problem we had with the dynamic response of the engine gimbaling actuators. The actuators were coupling dynamically with the thrust structure creating an undesirable high response, which compromised the controllability of the vehicle. Rich summed up the physics of the problem by saying that it only hurts at resonance. The people involved that were not convinced were the recipients of the statement. The name of Eggleston on the badge is one of the SIVB Stage Program managers that were having trouble accepting the existence of the problem. Rich‘s cartoons not only dealt with the physics of the problems but the human involvement as well.  - had to do with a control feedback potentiometer that was giving a problem. Getting rid of the potentiometer required the addition of additional elements that increased the complexity of the system. In those days the potentiometer was a series wound coil which the wiper arm moved across to create the signal. Each time the wiper arm encountered the next winding of the coil, the signal would jump in amplitude, creating a series of frequency pulses. The frequency of the pulses was introduced by the speed the arm was moving. This series of pulses was creating a dynamic problem. The quote; ―But it does get rid of the feedback pot‖, sums up the principle, that adding complexity creates additional problems. The cartoon illustrates this by the number and complex arrangement of parts in the base region of the SIV B Stage. \n",

      "We lost the first Jupiter missile due to an engine plume recirculation problem burning the actuator control wires. The second Jupiter launch was lost due to propellant sloshing dynamics coupling with the control system. [Ryan, September ; Abramson, SP- , ; Abramson, SP- , ].The control system was saturated and vehicle control was lost at max q. The first problem was fixed with the installation of a heat shield where the gas generator exhaust was dumped overboard; however the second problem required more work and engineering creativity. No analytical models existed for characterizing the dynamics of liquids in a tank, and this type of experimentation was an emerging technology. The problem became the instigator for a long term analytical and experimental technology development. Helmut Bauer at NASA and Norm Abramson at Southwest Research Institute were the leaders in this effort. [Bauer, ] However, this effort was downstream and we needed a quick solution so that Jupiter could be launched on time. We took the Jupiter LOX tank and put it on an empty railroad car and filled it with water. We then bumped the railroad car against the spur railroad stop, exciting the liquid dynamics. A movie camera recorded the motion and we were able to derive an equivalent slosh mass and frequency to be used in a control feedback simulation. The question then was: ―What is a fix for the problem?‖ so that we could launch the next vehicle. Someone said that when they were back on the farm and had to haul water in steel drums in a wagon, that they floated pieces of lumber on the surface to keep it from sloshing. Well, lumber would not work in a missile, but floating something would. The original design was a perforated cylinder truncated with cones and had a commode float inside to make it float. The entire surface was filled with these devices called\n",

      "Synthetic Wind Profile \n",
      "Early in Saturn development, we were challenged with the problem of representing the atmospheric wind characteristics in a manner that would allow -degree of freedom control and vehicle dynamic simulations to provide time consistent -sigma response data for structural design. Two creative ideas were required to meet this goal. The first involved a way of taking each single parameter sigma run of the -DOF response run and comparing it to a nominal run, extracting the differences for each response parameter. These deltas were then root-sum-squared (RSS‘d) and added to the nominal, producing the -sigma design values. The problem was that this discrete value was needed in combination with all other parameters in the time consistent manner in order to have a balanced load set. Jud Lovingood came up with a way of taking the -sigma deltas and ratioing them with the nominal to generate a ratio for the input parameters, which then provided a -sigma time consistent response. [Lovingood, J.A. ] In addition we needed a way of having the wind characteristics modeled in a time consistent manner for a forcing function for the -DOF simulation. Helmut Horn, Jim Socggins, Bill Vaughn and Robert Ryan came up with the synthetic profile based on a % wind speed and RSS‘d % wind shear and square waved wind gust. See  This was used very successfully in the early design of Saturn. [Geissler, E.D. et.al. ] The need arose to have a more realistic representation of the wind shear and gust, so a monthly set of detailed measurements were measured over a few years timeframe, that had the wind gust and shears correct to meter lengths. Using these detailed Jimsphere wind profiles a Monte Carlo approach was used to verify that accelerometer feedback load relief was not effective. As a result Saturn V flew without load relief. (See Lesson ) [Ryan,R.S. January - , ; Geissler, E.D. et.al. ] Since then a vector wind model and the Global Reference Atmosphere Model (GRAM) wind model have been developed for use in Shuttle and new programs. \n",

      "During Space Shuttle operational flights, liquid oxygen (LOX) pump bearings were a major problem, as were other elements such as turbine blades and welds. Bearings would wear out very quickly and along with other problems led to a requirement to refurbish the pumps after every one or two flights. Alternate turbopumps were proposed as a solution to these problems. The development of the alternate LOX turbopump was having major issues with the pump end bearings in that they would overheat and wear out in the first seconds of run time. This problem was threatening continuation of the program, and needed a quick solution. A team was formed to find a solution to the problem. They tried everything with nothing working. Prior to this team‘s formation a MSFC engineer Dr. Robert Thom, was thinking out of the box and came up with use of Silicon Nitride (SiNi) ball bearings and had a technology program in place to test the bearings in a bearing tester. The team was near the deadline of program cancelation unless a solution was found, when we decided to try the new SiNi balls. [Gibson, Jannaf- ] Silicon Nitride is a ceramic material. A manager of Pratt & Whitney was reluctant to try them and had said no one would put glass balls in his pump. A Pratt engineer took him into the shop and put a new ball bearing in a nylon sack and had him hit it with a large sledge hammer. The anvil and the hammer were dented, but the ball had no fracture under microscope inspection. As a result we started testing the balls in a pump and surprisingly there was no wear of the balls or the race. The results have been that pumps can fly times with no bearing wear. See  Currently, all space shuttle turbopumps have these SiNi bearings.\n",

As the satellite was deployed on a tether, the tether would set up dynamic oscillations (skip rope), which in the end could destroy the system. A team was formed to solve the problem through analysis and test. It was clear that some means of damping the oscillations was required. The approach was to install a damping system in the tether output ferrule using negator springs. As the tether dynamically moved, the dampers on the end of the cable attached to the eye through which the tether was deployed would move with the dynamic motion, thus damping the skip rope. After much testing the system was verified and flew very successfully on the first tether flight. See Figures - through - for details.\n",

In fact, it turns out that most of our roles are ―parts of an interrelated whole that work synergistically‖. After it is understood how the various roles play together and how they can be conditioned, our attitude relating to dealing with them will change and there will be a reduction in frustration. Instead of fighting the notion of all the ―things‖ that must be done ―now‖, accept it as a challenge. For instance, ―my hobby will be conquering my roles.‖ I‘ll interact with all those close to me, i.e., I‘ll let them know I have accepted the challenge and invite them to participate. They are now partners with me in my new hobby. Then as part of the challenge, put things in an appropriate perspective. Firstly, consider the time it takes to accomplish an activity. Sometimes deadlines are levied without any notion whatsoever regarding how long an activity will actually take. Also, if there is a real short- fuse deadline, make sure it is understood that the results will be a short-fuse result. Occasionally, everything can be dropped for a better than short-fuse result, but all of our activities can‘t run in the short-fuse timeline mode. Thus, the timeline of our activities must be understood and balanced. Secondly, consider the magnitude of the activities. Could it be that we can‘t tell what is important (big rocks) and what is not (sand pebbles)? When a set of activities is initiated, it might be difficult to determine what‘s important. The sensitivity of the outcome to the various activities has to be determined, i.e. what are the consequences of not doing a specific activity or reducing the level of effort. After the big rock activities are determined, what is their sequence? Thus the balance of the effort of the activities is determined. Now the important activities and their timelines are known and balanced. \n",

[Thorndike, ] In essence it takes the meshing of the physical, the emotional, and the intellectual to create readiness. Until the blending occurs performance is not up to par. When they mesh performance is high and graceful. It takes time (patience), and experience (practice) to achieve readiness. When it happens it is obvious. You don‘t give up easily on people. Provide time for the ―law of Readiness‖ to work. When coaching the Alabama Class ―A‖ Basketball Championship Team Robert Ryan had a ‘ ‖ center who was key to winning. John had a habit of rebounding the ball and then pulling it down to dribble or pass. We set up practice drills having him push the ball back to the goal or pass it out. Finally Ryan put a block over the goal so that the ball would bounce out for him to push back. After several weeks of this drill, Ryan was losing patience. John had no confidence and he couldn‘t get the hang of the principle. We worked one Friday and no progress was evident. Monday John came to practice performing the task with ease. Never again did he have to be reminded of the principle. Readiness works that way. Most of the time readiness appears to occur practically instantaneously but is built over a period of time. The authors have seen it work in areas of engineering, where all of a sudden everything fits. The process repeats as new skills are added.\n",

Growth implies first having a place of security from which to take off from. In this place one has social acceptance, equilibrium, control of one‘s domain, good feelings, calmness, and status. To grow means turning lose and floating in uncertainty while reaching for the new. This turning loose is a leap of faith based on a challenge, encompassed with vulnerability, falling, and other undesirable risks. Leadership and management have the role of providing a safety net in case the employee falls so that they are not destroyed. Grasping the challenge means surrendering abilities, status, techniques, awards, becoming a nonconformist, many times risking financial security. A more disciplined life is implied along with commitment. In the end comes recognition, adventure, growth, power, but more importantly fulfillment.

      "The guidance and control theory of growth is based on the principle of the guidance and control of space vehicles. The control system handles the short term disturbances by correcting the vehicle attitude against a reestablished path attitude. (Some form of optimization) Guidance is concerned with keeping the vehicle on the path to the goal (orbit). The guidance gains get tighter the closer the vehicle gets to the target. During peak disturbances guidance usually is de-emphasized and control becomes one of relieving the disturbances versus maintaining the guidance-prescribed attitude. An example is load relief control during high winds and high dynamic pressure, where the vehicle is turned into the wind to reduce loads. This load relief control introduces drift away from the ideal trajectory, thus some performance loss, in order to reduce the loads. Maintaining attitude would probably break the vehicle or result in large increases in structural weight thus reducing how much payload can be put in orbit. People should be developed, managed in the same manner.

The emphasis of this technical integration is primarily related to the systems aspects of the design process, i.e., technical management, certification of the system, etc. The primary focus is delivering the product with the proper balance of performance, cost, reliability, safety, operability, schedule, and TRL. Balance is achieved via managing and resolving conflict. All system related decisions and all system related technical conflicts are respectively made and resolved at this level. In addition, all system planning, control, and documentation is maintained at this level. \n",
      "Technical integration below the dashed crossbar is informal and is a key enabler for achieving a successful design. The vertical bars relate to subsystems, design functions, or discipline functions. There are a number of combinations of these (subsystems, design functions, or discipline functions) that require informal horizontal integration. The emphasis here is informal integration (communication) between and among subsystem, design function, or discipline while including the system. It can be hall-talk, phone calls, inter-office discussion, technical interchange meetings, etc. or other forms of communications. Since there are many vertical legs that affect each other, informal integration among these elements is critical. The functional organizations are the primary operatives of integration for discipline-to-discipline aspects of the design process, while the engineering design functions are the primary facilitators of integration for the subsystem-to-subsystem specific aspects of the design process. Recall, the vertical legs of the ―T‖ also represent discipline activities (analyses, tests, simulations, etc.) associate with subsystems and design functions. They signify in-depth knowledge (in the vertical direction) but with a system perspective. This in-depth knowledge is required to be accurate and with the associated uncertainty defined. \n",

In guarding an individual you in general don‘t slap down on the dribbler but slap up or to the side otherwise you get called for a foul. These are examples of informal interactions. The systems part is both formal and informal. The formal takes place by the team running patterns and then informal takes place by taking advantage and adapting to what the defense does such as the back door, or the pick and roll.

A plot of vehicle dry weight versus dry weight margin will basically trace this generic curve. What this means then is that as we move out on the performance curve, our design, verification and operations challenges go up non-linearly with the increase in performance requirements. It means that great attention must be used to design, build, verify and operate these high performance systems. The complexity factor of these systems also makes it much more difficult to predict and understand the system induced interactions. Poole in his book, ―Beyond Engineering: How Society Shapes Technology‖ says that the complexity factor leads to most of the failures and is very difficult to predict.

First, the vehicle lofted significantly more than was predicted indicating that there was an unpredicted bias moment acting on the vehicle. The vehicle at SRB separation was approximately , feet higher than predicted. The second anomaly had to do with the orbiter wing loads. The trajectory had been designed to fly the vehicle conservatively at a predicted % of the design limit load; however, the strain gauges showed that the wing was experiencing up to % of the design limit load in some areas. The two effects were due to the same cause. In designing the vehicle, wind tunnel tests were required to develop the vehicles aerodynamic characteristics. In order to accomplish an adequate test, the propulsion system plumes, including the atmospheric effect on their shape, had to be simulated using a solid plume. Analytical techniques available to make the estimate of plume characteristics at that time were crude and thus gave an inaccurate answer. The plumes, in conjunction with the tunneling effect between the Orbiter wings and the External Tank and the Solid Rocket Boosters, altered the aerodynamic distribution on the Orbiter wing, creating the unpredicted moment and the increased loads on the Orbiter wings.  - illustrates the effect. Initially no one believed the strain gauge and aerodynamic pressure data, requiring that all the strain gauges be recalibrated.

      "―Any of these forms of energy is capable of producing changes, changes in things; more exactly, redistribution of matter…Now whenever a change is made by passage of energy and a result is left, this event takes place in a group of things.

      "Thus, design is paradoxical. As a consequence, we balance the system to the degree possible among conflicting requirements. Because of the demanding, high-performance nature of launch systems, this balancing act associated with their design is especially challenging. Balancing must occur within the performance attributes of the system, and there must be balancing among technical performance attributes, the -ilities, and the programmatic attributes of cost and schedule. There can be tradeoffs between payload delivery capability, vehicle robustness, launch probability, and operational complexity. Problems that can‘t be cured in design must be compensated for in operational compromises and constraints. Knowledge of system risks is necessary to make correct tradeoff and balance decisions. The balancing act requires open communication and key decision judgments. \n",

      "For the ascent phase of flight, there are a number of flight mechanics parameters that must be traded to achieve the best balance of payload mass to orbit, launch availability, operational complexity, and system robustness. They include trajectory, control, loads, and thermal environment  - ). The basic trajectory is determined to maximize payload mass delivered to orbit. The control system orients the vehicle to follow the optimal trajectory. The more closely the vehicle can be controlled to the optimal trajectory, the more payload mass can be delivered to orbit from a flight-mechanics viewpoint. However, when the vehicle encounters winds, holding tightly to the optimal trajectory causes the aerodynamic loads to be relatively high. Higher aerodynamic loads require stronger, heavier structure, which reduces the payload mass delivery capability. We can relieve the wind-induced aerodynamic loads by turning the vehicle to reduce the angle of attack; however, this causes the trajectory to deviate from optimal. So there is a tradeoff required—a balancing act. Thermal environments can be affected by the flight path during the latter part of atmospheric ascent, so those considerations are also part of the balancing. \n",

If that expected wind were actually experienced during flight, there would be no wind-induced load on the vehicle. Of course, the actual wind always differs from the expected or predicted wind, so there will be wind loads caused by the difference between the actual and expected (biased) winds. Wind biasing allows the structure to be designed to withstand only the deviations from the expected wind, instead of the full range of winds possible for that time period. The disadvantage of wind biasing is operational complexity and cost. There will be more discussion of wind biasing later.\n",

Although controlling the vehicle to reduce the aerodynamic load generally entails deviating from the payload-optimized trajectory, using load relief control provides the most favorable net payload capability for many vehicle designs. However, it entails the addition of lateral accelerometer sensors and filtering, which adds failure modes and operational complexity. \n",

      "Wind Biasing \n",
      "As discussed earlier, wind biasing is a means of relieving loads during ascent. The choice of what wind-biasing time period to use for design is a tradeoff decision. See  For example, we can design for the expected (average) wind over a yearly, monthly, or daily (several hours) time period. In each case, the trajectory/guidance profile must be generated and loaded into the flight computer. Designing for a yearly wind bias would allow one profile to be used regardless of when the launch occurs during the year. This is operationally simple, but requires a strong vehicle, since the actual wind varies greatly during the year from the average annual wind. A monthly bias requires loading a profile for the specific month of launch, but reduces the design loads because wind variations within a month are smaller than within a year. Carrying the concept further, we can measure the wind on the day of launch and bias to that wind. Now the variability is much smaller, so the wind loads are reduced to those corresponding to only the wind variability within a few hours. The structure can then be lighter, but now there is a significant operational cost incurred on every flight, because on the day of launch the winds must be measured, the profiles must be generated, independently verified, and loaded into the flight computer. So a tradeoff decision is required. (Further details of day-of-launch biasing are given in Lesson .) \n",
      "If one designs for wind biasing for a given time period, the vehicle will have to operate with biasing for that period or a shorter period. One approach is to design for a monthly mean, for example, and hold in reserve the possibility of operating with day-of-launch biasing. This retains margin that can be used to accommodate downstream payload performance problems, increase launch probability, or provide mission flexibility.  - illustrates this concept.\n",

This margin in structural capability, along with margin in the propulsion system, provided mission flexibility that enabled carrying the Lunar Rover and launching Skylab, two applications that were not envisioned in the initial design. \n",
      "Space Shuttle followed a different path. Being a stage-and-a-half vehicle, it required a relatively more efficient (lighter-weight) structure than did the three-stage Saturn vehicle. The initial intent was to design for monthly mean wind biasing. However, the effects of the unexpected first flight aerodynamic anomaly discussed in Lesson meant that the as-built vehicle was not as strong as initially intended, and required day-of-launch wind biasing. Since there is no spread between the as-built point and the operate point, there is no margin benefit for Shuttle as was the case for Saturn.\n",

      "On the Saturn V / Apollo vehicle, the usual trade study was done to determine potential benefits of using load relief control. Analysis that modeled the vehicle as a rigid body showed that there was sufficient reduction of basic aerodynamic loads to recommend using load relief control. However, when structural flexibility was included in the analysis, it was found that adding load relief control significantly increased the loads on the upper one-third of the vehicle, due to accentuated bending response to gusts. This detrimental effect on the upper third of the vehicle outweighed the beneficial effect of rigid-body load relief on the middle third of the vehicle, resulting in a decision to not use load relief on Saturn V. [Ryan, R. , Geissler, E.D. ]. This example also illustrates the importance of employing sufficient fidelity in trade studies so as to avoid an erroneous conclusion. \n",

Reusing the SRB‘s entailed development of recovery methodology, on-board systems, recovery vessels and infrastructure, refurbishment and inspection process, etc. [Nevins, ] \n",

There are several events related to water impact that produce major loads on the SRB, as illustrated on Figures - and - : ( ) the initial splashdown causes large loads on the nozzle and aft skirt, ( ) the air cavity created by the splashdown collapses and the water slams the aft part of the case, ( ) maximum depth penetration creates hydrostatic loads, ( ) the SRB buoys up vertically, then slaps down horizontally, creating side-loads on the forward part of the case.

There were trade-offs for parachute sizing and assessment of sea state probabilities, along with economic analyses to assess the cost benefit of recovering and reusing the hardware. The conclusion reached was that booster recovery and reuse would be cost effective if there were no more than % attrition of the hardware due to recovery damage. So there was a probabilistic balance-point, or target, for the recovery system design. The initial desire was to not modify the ascent SRB design for any recovery loading events, but to accept whatever attrition would occur. However, because the actual cavity-collapse loads were consistently higher than predicted, a design modification was made to strengthen the aft segment. While one pair of SRB‘s were lost because of a parachute triggering device malfunction, there have so far been no SRB‘s lost because of the probabilistically-defined variables such as sea states, parachute deployment conditions, etc. A major advantage of recovering the SRB‘s is the ability to inspect the recovered hardware and determine its post-use condition. This has proved important in determining actual margins (such as for thermal protection) and revealing incipient problems. [McCool, ] \n",

      "SSME Fatigue Issues \n",
      "The high performance of the SSME coupled with the high power density, discussed in the earlier section on the challenge of space travel, created many fracture and fatigue problems. [Ryan, et al, in Chaffe, ] The high pressure turbo pumps turbine blades is one classical example. There were two types of fatigue experienced in the SSME program: ( ) Low cycle fatigue, ( ) High cycle fatigue. The low cycle fatigue is introduced by the cycle between low and very high pressures and temperatures. At maximum operating conditions the temperature is R and at shutdown the pump is purged with low temperature gaseous nitrogen. The fuel pump with its preburner is about ‘ long, weighs pounds and rotates about , RPM, generating , HP. Each turbine blade, about the size of a man‘s thumb, generates HP. As the turbine spins, the driving gas is guided with vanes, which creates a fluctuating pressure on the each blade as it passes each vane. This introduces vibration in the blade that leads to high cycle fatigue. \n",
      "The fix for the high cycle fatigue was to install a damper between the blade platform and the wheel it is mounted in. During the test where the failure occurred the gold plating used on the damper to eliminate hydrogen effects failed and the blade damper became ineffective. The fix involved disallowance of platings on the damper. No additional problems occurred with this blade during the tenure of the Rocketdyne pumps on Shuttle.  - shows the fuel pump blade;  - depicts the LOX pump blade that had a low cycle fatigue problem. The low cycle fatigue was caused by the thermal cycling the blade experienced in going from a very high operating temperature to ambient temperature during shutdown. The crack growth phenomenon was controlled though inspections, ground test hot fire history and the application of the % fleet leader rule. This rule says that no part can fly on a Shuttle mission that does not have twice the time on two identical parts in ground tests. This rule has been applied to all critical SSME parts and components. •DESCRIPTION•HIGH CYCLE FATIGUE•STAGE PROPAGATION•CAUSED BY DAMPER / BLADE BONDING•NON-PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION•RATIONALE FOR ACCEPTANCE•ELIMINATED BY DISALLOWANCE OF PLATING ON DAMPERS \n",

This contact angle depended on how the RMS captured the second body and its position relative to the station.

The bearing material was C steel. When the alternate turbopump was designed the housing consisted of investment castings that eliminated welds and sheet metal. The bearing material is silicon nitride and the rotating assembly has about half the number of parts as the original design. Another design goal would be to simplify load paths.

This is the basis for the root-sum-square (RSS) methodology.

Sensitivity factor analyses provide insights in providing the best choices; thus enabling the best designs. For example, in the design of a liquid rocket vehicle system, the payload can be increased by increasing the engine specific impulse. Suppose a payload gain of pounds could be achieved for a one second increase in engine specific impulse. Then for a second increase in specific impulse, the payload would increase pounds. Thus the designer can decide how much to increase the specific impulse to achieve the payload requirement. In that decision process, the impact on engine design would have to be assessed along with other consequential interactive effects. In this example, the sensitivity factor would have been obtained through system performance analysis. In other situations, sensitivity factors can be also obtained through test or simulation \n",
      "High performance systems have high sensitivities and uncertainties which complicates the design. If a comparison is made between the design efficiency (power/pound) of a rocket stage and an airplane, the rocket stage is about two orders of magnitude higher in design efficiency. If compared to an automobile, the rocket stage is about three orders of magnitude higher. In consideration of uncertainty, one of the complicating factors in designing a launch vehicle is the uncertainty in the atmospheric winds. To deal with this uncertainty, the winds on the day of launch are measured to verify that conditions are satisfactory to fly. \n",
      "Sensitivities and uncertainties have to be determined and assessed through all stages of the design process. This requires attention to design detail to assess the best design decisions and potential for reducing uncertainty. In fact, uncertainty can in some cases be reduced by reducing sensitivities. Uncertainties can be determined from historical data bases, tests, and expert opinion. A major concern in design is determining the uncertainties in the output variables in terms of uncertainties in the input variables. Some of the methods used to assess uncertainty are root-sum-square (RSS) and Monte Carlo simulations. \n",

Knowing the associated PDF‘s, the reliability of the design can be determined. In the example shown, the design would be unacceptable because of the size of the interference region.

The vehicle is unsymmetrical in the pitch plane with the orbiter attached on the side of the External Tank and Solid Rocket Motors. The vehicle is held to the Mobile Launch Pad (MLP) with four pyrotechnic bolts on each solid. See the following figure. The vehicle is first filled with the cryogenic liquid propellants which shrinks the External Tank longitudinal and in diameter. For example the aft SRB to ET attachment strut is at degrees to perpendicular before filling the tank and becomes perpendicular due to the cryogenic shrinkage when the tanks are filled. In addition its diameter shrinks approximately inches. This stores energy into the structure. At the start of the on pad liftoff cycle the SSME‘s are ignited and carried to % thrust to ensure engine health. The engines are canted for c.g. tracking and are offset from the vehicle center line several feet. This stores additional energy in the structure in two ways. The orbiter is lifted up bending the vehicle over the attached points introducing a large bending moment in the system. This can be illustrated visually by watching the launch of Shuttle observing the tank tip moving laterally approximately inches. This sets up a dynamic motion of the vehicle on the pad about the mean moment introduced by the SSME thrust. Since the engines are offset, they also push the Orbiter and ET between the two motors that are holding the vehicle to the pad. [Ryan, ] \n",

The constraint was necessary for the elimination of buffeting of the Orbiter tail section and to keep induced environments such as loads within bounds. The vehicle performance is very sensitive to the constraints of controlling dynamic pressure and staying within the longitudinal acceleration limit ofg‘s. The following listing shows the sensitivities and general characteristics. In general reducing q by psf by throttling is a loss of pounds of payload while lofting cost pounds of payload for a psf reduction. In order to implement these constraints the SSME has to throttle to the minimum possible which is determined by the dynamic loads in the nozzle as thrust is lowered. This is a result of the requirement that the nozzle shape be optimized for operation from ground to vacuum and is a compromise of the nozzle instability versus maximum performance in vacuum. The SRM grain had to be shaped such that there was also a SRM thrust reduction during Max q. Finally an adaptive guidance scheme for SSME throttling was instituted to obtain increased vehicle performance as compared with a predetermined SSME throttling profile.

The approach taken was to use a flex bearing and seal made of eleven rubber/steel laminations. Moving the nozzle to vector the thrust requires large actuator forces to overcome the high stiffness of the flex bearing and seal, plus other loads such as aerodynamic forces. Actuator deflections, rates, and accelerations must be adequate for controllability and control stability. In turn, large actuator forces require high output hydraulic power supplies in the aft skirts, along with the attendant complexities of handling hazardous fuels.

At Conceptual/Initial Design, the design space is open, allowing essentially free choice of design variables to meet the mission requirements.

Military requirements dictated larger payloads and greater reentry cross-range than did NASA‘s requirements. DoD required a nautical mile cross-range to enable landing at the launch site after a once-around delivery orbit. NASA‘s cross-range requirement was less, being dictated by abort considerations. There were two competing Orbiter configurations: a delta-wing design needed to produce sufficient hypersonic lift/drag ratio to achieve the DoD cross-range requirement, and a simpler straight-wing design that could satisfy the NASA requirement. Because the vehicle design had to envelope both requirements, a delta wing was chosen. \n",

After L, the Critical Items List (CIL) assessment for welds was expanded to identify all critical welds. The idea was to prepare rationale for retention for all welds prior to flight, identify and implement corrective action as required, and establish a weld data base for rapid screening of future weld issues. At that time, the material data base contained pages of design properties. Forty-three percent of these were predicted minimums with some unverifiable sources, extrapolations, and empirical relationships. The material data base was upgraded to include SSME materials tested in tests with in high pressure hydrogen. In addition, the fracture mechanics data base was expanded including weld defect testing. \n",

In the test of engine E ( / / ) [Hopson, July, ] and engine E ( / / ) [Hopson, September, ], LOX posts again failed due to HCF. However, these cracks occurred at the top of the posts in the inertial weld region in the vicinity of the interpropellant plate, see  - , circleLOX flowed through the cracks into the region between the interpropellant plate and the secondary face plate causing a fire. It is thought that the E failure resulted from a more severe (unanticipated) flow environment in going from RPL to FPL and from modifications to the fuel turbopump to achieve FPL. The LOX posts were then redesigned for the more severe environment. In the case of the subsequent engine E failure, inspection of some of the undamaged posts revealed manufacturing defects in the inertia weld even though there had been pretest inspections. Inspection procedures were improved to mitigate future failures. Eventually, all LOX post material was changed to HaynesThe changes made to the injector assembly resulted in a reduction of the engine ISP of aboutseconds ( pound payload reduction). \n",

These increased cross-sectional areas have the effect of reducing the dynamic pressure (½ρV ) and thus the static and dynamic flow loads. Then inlet and outlet regions of the tubes were rounded.

      "The requirements for the Space Shuttle to launch and service the International Space Station (ISS) resulted in the need to increase the Shuttle ascent performance. The Shuttle had been flying several years and was basically a fixed configuration. Therefore the major approach open for performance increase was a weight reduction program of the major components of the Shuttle. The External Tank was a prime target for mass reduction, since a one pound tank weight reduction produced a one pound performance increase.  - illustrates that by changing the material of the tank to aluminum lithium and changing its construction to orthogrid while maintaining its external configuration and tank volume saved , pounds of weight and resulted in a payload increase of , pounds. To accomplish this dramatic change, a reverification of the structure and the fracture mechanics program was required. [Presentation by Neil Otte, Ryan‘s working papers] Also the manufacturing process and the weld repair process had to be changed and verified. Protoflight testing of the hydrogen tank in conjunction with proof test was an additional complication that required each tank built to have the protoflight test to insure the tank had adequate buckling margins. The lesson is clear-- changing requirements during operations of a program adds additional risks and cost.\n",

      "Wind biasing as a means of reducing structural load was discussed in Lesson on the Balancing Act. There we noted that the Shuttle was intended to be designed with enough structural strength to allow launch using a trajectory biased for the monthly mean wind. Because of the aerodynamic anomaly described in Lesson , the Shuttle in fact wasn‘t strong enough to be launched with monthly mean biasing, but required biasing for the winds measured on the day of launch. A Day of Launch I-Load Update (DOLILU) process was required, which entailed significant operational complexity and expense. Wind biasing involves calculating the guidance parameters based on the bias wind, and loading them into the flight computer. With monthly mean biasing, this process can be accomplished and verified well ahead of launch day, but with day-of-launch wind biasing, all this must be done in a short time span based on winds measured a few hours prior to launch.

The wind measured at L minus : hours is smoothed and used to bias the first-stage guidance commands so that if the vehicle in flight should experience that same wind, there would be no wind-induced loads. In actuality, the wind will change between the time the balloon measures it and the vehicle flies through it, but biasing to the balloon-measured wind will minimize the wind-induced load. The biased first-stage guidance commands that have been generated must be verified, approved, and then loaded into the flight computer prior to launch.

These variations are combined statistically as ―knock-down‖ factors on the structural capability to produce load indicator boundaries called Q-planes as a function of altitude. The simulated response of the vehicle using the I-load must lie within these boundaries; otherwise, the launch is no-go. An additional Q-plane check is made using the wind measured by a subsequent balloon closer to launch (L minus : hours).

Putty was applied as a thermal barrier between the facing surfaces of the mated segment insulation.

The gap at the clevis-tang joint opened when the SRM ignited and pressurized the case, exceeding the ability of the primary and secondary O-rings to resiliently respond at cold temperatures and maintain the joint seal. In addition, there were factors that contributed to the failure of that specific SRM joint. Although it is not considered good design practice to rely on pressure to actuate O-ring seals, pressure going around and under the O-rings had most likely aided the material resiliency to seal most SRM joints. The O-ring groove tolerances on the SRMs allowed the possibility that both sides of the O-ring could be in contact with the groove, which would have hindered pressure actuation. Furthermore, the relative diameters of the tang and clevis were a factor. When the SRM cases are reused and proof tested, their diameters undergo a slight permanent change.

This places more risks on the first flights and can result in design changes after hardware is built which within itself is as costly. This principle has been demonstrated in most space flight projects. Avionics components and mechanisms have at least six types of tests: development, qualification, verification, certification, assurance, and acceptance. Finally any test is based on a set of assumptions; therefore, no test is better than the assumptions used in the test hardware and the test conditions and environments. \n",

Examples of failures include: LOX posts, main oxidizer valve, flow meter, splitters, high pressure fuel pump impeller, capacitor probe, etc. \n",

For example, flow analyses in the H- , F- , and J- engine programs were one and two dimensional and the chamber pressures were: Pc = (H- , psi; F- , psi; and J- , psi). In addition, these engines were expendable. In comparison to the SSME, its chamber pressure is psi and the engines are reusable. The static and dynamic flow induced loads can increase by at least the ratio of the chamber pressures (e.g. factor of three from F- to SSME). \n",

However, improved computer capacity and speed, advanced numerical methods, and turbulence modeling could potentially enable application of CFD to design. In CFD was introduced into the design process with the goal of making it a design tool. To achieve that goal the following requirements were implemented: ( ) Integrate/improve the capabilities of propulsion contractors, academia, CFD specialists, and government flow analysts; ( ) Improve CFD methods/codes as required for design; ( ) Benchmark CFD methods/codes for engine application; and ( ) Implement results into design process.\n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "This completes a study of Lessons Learned in Engineering. The lessons derived from the authors‘ experience have been distilled into principles that should be applicable across all technical areas. The principles and lessons are only important if applied. The key issue we face is the application of these principles and lessons to engineering organizations as well as their products. \n",
      "A related question asked by the Directors of Engineering at MSFC was: ―How do we achieve excellence in engineering?‖ The authors‘ approach to answering this broader question was a short course on Excellence in Engineering which is documented in a future NASA CR titled Excellence in Engineering. \n",
      "We started this report with a set of nine generic principles based on lessons derived from our experiences in space flight systems. These principles and corollaries are repeated below. \n",
      "Lessons Learned Principles \n",
      "I. System success depends on the creativity, judgment, and decision-making skills of the people \n",
      "- People are our most important resource \n",
      "II. Space systems are challenging, high performance systems \n",
      "- High energy, high power density \n",
      "- Therefore, high sensitivity \n",
      "III. Everything acts as a system (whole) \n",
      "- We design by compartmentalization and reintegration \n",
      "- Understanding interfaces and interactions is crucial \n",
      "- Requires pervasive communications \n",
      "IV. The system is governed by the laws of physics \n",
      "- Reality can‘t be ignored \n",
      "- Look to the real performance of the hardware and software\n",

      "V. Robust design is based on our understanding of sensitivities, uncertainties, and margins \n",
      "- Must consider sensitivities, uncertainties, margins, risks \n",
      "- Aim for robustness \n",
      "VI. Project success is determined by life cycle considerations \n",
      "- Program constraints can result in a non-optimal design \n",
      "- Requirements can drive the design in unexpected ways \n",
      "- Early phases of project most influential on design \n",
      "- Design must consider full life cycle including\n",
