Rocketry LLM: Fine tune a pretrained Q&A LLM Model for Rocket Engineering Q&A. Fine tuning data is curated from sources including Wikipedia, Arxiv rocketry papers, NASA technical papers, Rocketry stackexchange, etc. 
 
In cases such as the Arxiv rocketry papers which don't come with questions paired to answers, we use a question-generating LLM to generate questions paired with paragraphs as answers and thus obtain Q&A data set. 

This is a chat bot to support study and research in rocket and space engineering.
